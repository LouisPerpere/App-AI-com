The AI engineer's trajectory involved a complex debugging and feature refinement process for the Claire et Marcus PWA. Initially, efforts focused on resolving critical frontend issues: a keyboard disappearing bug on virtual keyboards and pervasive data persistence failures, alongside refactoring the website analysis module.

Early attempts to fix data persistence involved iterating through various React event handlers (, , ),  management, and  integration. A key challenge was differentiating behavior for virtual vs. physical keyboards, leading to  attributes and  for uncontrolled inputs. The  function was repeatedly identified as a culprit for data erasure, particularly for dropdowns/radio buttons, leading to their conversion to text inputs and the disabling of  for these specific fields.

The conversation then expanded to include issues with notes functionality (not appearing, priority resetting) and the website analysis module (not functioning, authentication issues). The AI engineer frequently utilized the  to identify deeper, architectural root causes, revealing race conditions in data loading, inconsistent state management between  and API responses, and authentication mismatches.

Significant efforts were made to unify data loading/saving logic across all form fields, ensuring  and API synchronization. Backend issues, such as missing  and unescaped MongoDB URL characters, repeatedly caused deployment failures on Render, requiring fixes in , , , and a fallback mechanism for the website analyzer. The final persistent issue of demo business data overriding user input pointed to hardcoded demo data in backend files, a fundamental architectural flaw identified by the . The trajectory concludes with the diagnosis of this backend issue and the plan to fix it.

Claire et Marcus (formerly PostCraft) is a PWA SaaS for small businesses, automating social media content generation using AI. It features AI-powered content, business profile creation, and publication calendars for Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Key enhancements include tiered subscriptions, a ChatGPT-powered website analysis, a sexy marketing UI, intelligent paywall, and full business profile editability, along with a rebranding.

The immediate focus of the previous work involved resolving critical UI/data bugs:
1.  **Keyboard disappearing bug:** Persistent issue on text input fields, especially on iOS/iPadOS 18, impacting both Entreprise and Notes pages. The user explicitly requested ensuring the fix applies to all virtual keyboard devices.
2.  **Data persistence issue:** User-entered data would disappear on page reload or tab switch, specifically within the Entreprise tab.
3.  **Website Analysis Module Refactoring:** The module needed its UI moved to a dedicated section (separate tab/page) to prevent interference with other form fields, improve user feedback, and prevent accidental data overwrites on the main business profile.
4.  **Dropdown/Radio Button Erasure:** Selecting options in type d’entreprise (Enterprise page) and priorité (Notes page) dropdowns/radio buttons caused entire forms to erase. The user requested replacement with either checkboxes or free text fields.
5.  **Website Analysis Functionality:** Ensure the website analysis module functions correctly and returns valid analysis.
6.  **ChatGPT Model Upgrade:** Migrate the AI backend for website analysis to ChatGPT 5.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into resolving a critical and persistent data persistence issue on the "Entreprise" page. Despite numerous fixes to the frontend (`App.js`) to unify data loading and saving logic across fields (e.g., ensuring `dbValue || currentValue || localValue` prioritization), the user reported that most fields (e.g., "Nom de lentreprise) would revert to Démo Business on page reload, while the Site web field *did* persist correctly.

This led to another invocation of the , which identified the root cause: the  field was being handled *outside* of the unified data protection logic in  (lines 1366-1367 in ), causing it to always overwrite with demo values and potentially affecting other fields. The engineer had just applied a fix to bring  under the same protective loading logic as  and other fields, for both virtual keyboard and desktop modes.

The backend testing agent was then used to confirm this fix, which reported 100% persistence for all fields. However, the very last user message () stated: Non il y a toujours quelquechose qui fait que démo business revient à la place du nom modifié. This indicates the issue is still not fully resolved, and the current hypothesis from the  (invoked in ) is that the problem is not in the frontend logic but in the backend, which might be systematically returning demo data due to failing fallbacks.
