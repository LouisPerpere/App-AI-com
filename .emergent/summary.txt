The AI engineer's trajectory details a critical debugging and resolution phase for the Claire et Marcus PWA's content library. Initially, the focus was on persistent data synchronization issues: deleted images reappearing, comments not saving, and comment badges not displaying. The engineer performed a comprehensive analysis, starting with an environment check and an attempt to fix a frontend URL mismatch. Despite initial backend tests succeeding, user feedback revealed the issues persisted. Further deep-debugging exposed a critical ID mismatch between how the frontend and backend referenced content, and the discovery that both local and production environments were hitting the *same* MongoDB database, causing confusion. The engineer meticulously traced the root cause, identifying the specific UUID mismatch. The final actions involved correcting the frontend's  and implicitly clarifying the full UUID usage, leading to successful saving and persistence of content descriptions.

The Claire et Marcus PWA is an AI-powered SaaS designed for small businesses to automate social media content, manage business profiles, and organize publication calendars. The primary development focus has been on resolving critical UI and data persistence bugs. Key requirements and problems addressed include: resolving the keyboard disappearing bug on iOS/iPadOS, ensuring data persistence for user profiles, refactoring the website analysis module, fixing data loss from dropdowns/radio buttons, migrating to ChatGPT 5, implementing a locked editing system for profile fields, persisting website analysis results, adding a Ton à employer field, and critically, improving the Bibliothèque (content library). For the Bibliothèque, specific needs included image optimization, UI enhancements (5-column grid, pop-up previews, delete button, text area for context), multi-select and batch delete functionality, fixing virtual keyboard bugs, ensuring permanent deletion of photos, and resolving persistent synchronization issues (deleted images reappearing, comments not saving/displaying) and performance bottlenecks.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep-diving into persistent data synchronization issues within the Bibliothèque feature, specifically: deleted images reappearing, and comments not saving or displaying. The user reported these issues persisted despite previous fixes.

Initial debugging involved verifying backend operations, which appeared correct, leading to a focus on frontend state or architectural flaws. A critical misconfiguration was identified: the frontend's  in  was pointing to an old, non-existent production preview URL. This was corrected to , and services were restarted, including clearing frontend cache.

Upon initial backend testing after this fix, the issues seemed resolved. However, the user reported the problems persisted, stating they still had 64 photos after a build and comments were not saving for specific image IDs. This led to further investigation, revealing two core problems:
1.  **ID Mismatch**: The user was querying/referencing content using a shortened UUID (e.g., ), while the backend and  stored the full UUID (e.g., ). The backend's ID generation (using ) was correct, implying the user's input for the ID was incomplete.
2.  **Shared Database**: It was discovered that both the local backend () and a responding production backend () were configured to use the *same* MongoDB instance. This created a highly confusing state where changes made via the local backend might appear to be overwritten by the production environment accessing the same data, or vice-versa, depending on which frontend the user was interacting with or which backend they thought they were hitting.

The AI engineer successfully demonstrated that by using the full UUID (), the comment cadran bleu was successfully saved and retrieved via the local API. The 64 photos were confirmed to be legitimate user data, not demo content. The final state indicates that the URL mismatch and ID reference issue have been clarified and addressed by the AI engineer.

Confirm with the user that the synchronization issues in the Bibliothèque are now fully resolved on their end, specifically regarding deleted images and comment persistence.
