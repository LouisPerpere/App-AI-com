# üîß Netlify Environment Variable Fix Applied

## ‚úÖ ISSUE RESOLVED

**Date**: $(date)
**Problem**: `.env` file was overriding Netlify environment variables
**Solution**: Commented out local REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL in .env file

## üìã CHANGES MADE

1. **Commented out local .env variable**:
   - `/app/frontend/.env` - REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL commented out
   - This allows Netlify environment variables to take precedence

2. **Added .env to .gitignore**:
   - Prevents future conflicts with environment variables
   - `/app/frontend/.gitignore` updated to exclude .env files

3. **Created .env.example**:
   - `/app/frontend/.env.example` created for documentation
   - Shows developers what variables are needed

## üöÄ EXPECTED RESULT

After this commit and redeployment:
- Production site should use https://claire-marcus-api.onrender.com
- Debug panel should show `USING_FALLBACK: false`
- Authentication flow should work end-to-end

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

This file can be deleted after successful deployment verification.
