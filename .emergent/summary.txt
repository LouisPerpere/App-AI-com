The AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing and enhancing the Claire et Marcus SaaS application after its initial MVP build. Key challenges involved resolving persistent frontend UI/input bugs, debugging complex authentication issues stemming from environment variable misconfigurations across Netlify and Render.com, and refining backend-frontend data flow. The engineer employed a methodical, iterative approach, first diagnosing issues via logs and testing agents, then attempting various fixes for the keyboard disappearing bug, button width issues, and data save problems. Although many minor issues were resolved, the keyboard bug proved highly elusive, leading to multiple architectural refactorings of input handling. The process highlighted the complexity of deploying full-stack applications with inter-service dependencies and environment specific behaviors.

Claire et Marcus (formerly PostCraft) is a PWA SaaS designed to automate social media management for small businesses. Its core functionality revolves around AI-powered content generation, allowing users to create AI-recommended business profiles and generate monthly publication calendars. The application emphasizes unique, non-repetitive content, validated by users before publishing to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Essential features include content generation, upload reminders, fallback content, and a planned SaaS back office for client/subscription/payment management. Recent enhancements have introduced various subscription tiers (1-month free; Starter €14.99; Rocket €29.99; Pro €199.99), a ChatGPT-powered website analysis feature (quarterly/manual), a refined sexy marketing UI, intelligent paywall logic (conditional pop-ups, trial prevention), and full business profile editability. The application has also undergone a complete rebranding to Claire et Marcus, including a new logo, slogan, and dynamic typography.

- ****: Main FastAPI application.
    - **Importance**: Central API routes for the application.
    - **Changes Made**: Initially simplified for Render deployment by removing  and local module imports. Authentication endpoints were later re-added and debugged.  was added to  model and API responses. A duplicated  endpoint was removed. The  router was integrated for Stripe functionality. CORS configuration  was confirmed.
- ****: Backend environment variables.
    - **Importance**: Stores sensitive API keys and database connection strings.
    - **Changes Made**: Added , , , , , .
- ****: (New file) Modern Stripe integration.
    - **Importance**: Implements the secure Stripe checkout flow, manages packages, webhooks, and subscriptions for Starter, Rocket, and Pro plans. Uses .
    - **Changes Made**: Created to handle complete Stripe integration, including security features and webhook handling.
- ****: (New file) MongoDB database connection logic.
    - **Importance**: Manages connection to MongoDB, replacing any demo mode data persistence.
    - **Changes Made**: Created to set up  and handle database connection, providing client/database instances.
- ****: Main React component.
    - **Importance**: Defines UI layout, routing, and primary state management for the application.
    - **Changes Made**: Extensive UI refactoring for Claire et Marcus branding. Integrated  and . Persistent debugging and refactoring for input fields: initially memoized  handlers, added  props, experimented with , , and wrapper components (, ). Ultimately, the approach shifted to using separate  variables for each input field to prevent re-renders, and the Modifier le profil button and its modal were removed in favor of direct inline editing for better UX and to resolve the keyboard bug. Social media platform options (Twitter, TikTok, YouTube) were removed from preferred platforms.
- ****: Handles user authentication UI.
    - **Importance**: Manages login and registration forms and their interactions with the backend.
    - **Changes Made**: Major UI overhaul. Debugged  storage and API calls to match backend expectations. The simple state management pattern used here for inputs (direct object spread ) became the reference for fixing the persistent keyboard bug in . Error handling was also improved.
- ****: Frontend environment variables.
    - **Importance**: Stores frontend configuration, notably  for backend API calls.
    - **Changes Made**:  was initially updated to point to Render.com, then temporarily cleared/commented out to debug Netlify environment variable interference. Later, the  definition was removed from this file as it was found to interfere with Netlify dashboard variables.
- ****: Git ignore rules for frontend.
    - **Importance**: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore.
    - **Changes Made**: Added  to prevent local environment variables from being committed and interfering with deployment environments.
- ****: (New file) A markdown file created to document steps for fixing authentication issues on Netlify.
    - **Importance**: Provides a guide for troubleshooting Netlify deployments related to authentication.
    - **Changes Made**: Created to outline potential causes and solutions for authentication failures in the deployed environment.
- ****: (New file) A temporary React component for debugging authentication issues.
    - **Importance**: Used to display environment variables and backend health checks in the UI for debugging purposes.
    - **Changes Made**: Created to provide visual feedback on the  and backend connectivity. Later removed once the debugging purpose was served.

    - **Changes Made**: Created to list the necessary environment variables for the frontend setup, ensuring consistency across environments.
- ****: (New file) Temporary file to force Netlify redeployment.
    - **Importance**: Used as a dummy file to trigger a redeployment on Netlify, essential for applying environment variable changes.
    - **Changes Made**: Created for the specific purpose of forcing a Netlify deployment.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the full implementation and testing of the SaaS back office for client, subscription, and payment management, including additional payment providers (Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal). (Basic Stripe is integrated in demo mode).
- Re-integrate and fully enable backend modules like  and  into the deployed  on Render.com, as the current deployed  is still a minimal version (though  and payments are integrated). This includes a fully working MongoDB connection.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into resolving the highly persistent keyboard disappearing on text input bug in the frontend, which caused users to type only one character at a time. This bug continued to plague the application despite multiple attempts at fixing it, including:
1.  **Initial attempts**: Implementing memoized  handlers (, ) and adding  props to input elements in  to prevent excessive re-renders.
2.  **Native HTML inputs**: Replacing Shadcn UI  and  components with native HTML elements in  to rule out component-specific issues.
3.  **Isolated Components**: Creating and using dedicated , , , and  components to encapsulate input fields and manage their state independently, aiming to prevent parent component re-renders. These attempts were later reverted.
4.  **Auth.js pattern replication**: Reverting to the simple state management pattern observed in , where individual fields are managed by separate  variables rather than a single complex object state. This involved significant refactoring in  to use , , etc.
5.  **Direct Inline Editing**: The most recent major change was to eliminate the Modifier le profil button and its associated modal entirely. Instead, the business profile fields on the main company page in  were made directly editable. This was done to simplify the UI flow and mitigate the re-rendering issues by removing the complexity of a modal and separate edit state.

Despite these extensive efforts, the user explicitly stated in the last message (Chat Message 442) that the keyboard bug subsists even with the improved direct editing interface. The user also praised the new interface (L’interface est bien mieux comme ça) and requested the removal of the save button, with automatic saving on field edit completion. The save bug, which caused data to be erased, was previously identified as a backend demo mode issue, returning hardcoded data instead of persisting changes.

At this point, the AI engineer is acknowledging the persistent keyboard bug and the request for auto-save, and is planning to try yet another approach for the keyboard bug, specifically using React refs to entirely bypass React's state-driven re-renders for the problematic input fields, alongside implementing the auto-save functionality.
