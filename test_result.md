# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# Testing Data - Main Agent and testing sub agent both should log testing data below this section

user_problem_statement: "CRITICAL DATA DISAPPEARING BUG: User-entered data disappears after 0.25 seconds in form fields, particularly affecting iPadOS 18 virtual keyboard devices. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Input fields using defaultValue='' instead of actual business profile/localStorage data, causing fields to reset on re-renders. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Updated all virtual keyboard input fields to use dynamic defaultValue from businessProfile or localStorage instead of empty strings. This prevents data loss during component re-renders triggered by API calls or state changes."

CRITICAL FINDINGS: The frontend website analysis module exists and is accessible, the test URL https://my-own-watch.fr is properly populated in the website field, and the analysis button is present and clickable. However, based on the user report and previous backend testing showing 100% success, this suggests a frontend-specific issue with error handling or response parsing when the backend returns successful analysis results. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent should investigate frontend JavaScript error handling in the analyzeWebsite function, particularly the error message display logic that shows '❌ Analyse non concluante, vérifiez votre site web' even when backend returns successful responses."

SOLUTION: (1) Added autoSaveField('business_type', value) calls to business_type onBlur/onTouchEnd handlers, (2) Added localStorage persistence for note_priority in onBlur/onTouchEnd handlers, (3) Updated restoreFieldsFromStorage() to restore note_priority from localStorage, (4) Updated notePriority defaultValue to use localStorage fallback.

        comment: "❌ BUSINESS PROFILE VIRTUAL KEYBOARD BUG CONFIRMED: Extensive testing confirms the virtual keyboard bug is still present in ALL business profile fields on iPad viewport (1024x768). SPECIFIC FIELD FAILURES: (1) ❌ business_name: Only retains 'V' instead of full text 'Virtual keyboard test 1 - iPadOS 18 fix validation', (2) ❌ business_description: Textarea fails with same issue, (3) ❌ target_audience: Text truncation to single character, (4) ❌ email: Email field affected by same bug, (5) ❌ website_url: URL field shows same pattern, (6) ❌ budget_range: Budget field also failing. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS: The virtual keyboard detection logic is triggering but the field handling is causing severe text truncation. All fields show 'V' as the only preserved character, suggesting the typing simulation is being interrupted by the virtual keyboard handling code. The auto-save debouncing (800ms) and focus management are interfering with text input. SUCCESS ON OTHER VIEWPORTS: Mobile (390x844) and Desktop (1920x1080) work correctly, confirming the issue is specific to iPad-sized virtual keyboard scenarios."

        comment: "🔧 KEYBOARD BUG FIX IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED: Implemented comprehensive solution to resolve persistent keyboard disappearing bug in business profile editing. TECHNICAL CHANGES: (1) ✅ SEPARATE STATE VARIABLES: Replaced complex businessProfile object updates with individual useState hooks (editBusinessName, setEditBusinessName, editBusinessDescription, setEditBusinessDescription, etc.) to prevent React re-renders that caused focus loss, (2) ✅ AUTO-SAVE functionality: Implemented onBlur auto-save for all form fields using autoSaveField() function, eliminates need for manual save button as requested by user, (3) ✅ INITIALIZATION LOGIC: Added proper initialization of editing fields in loadBusinessProfile() and useEffect hooks to sync with loaded data, (4) ✅ USER PROFILE FIELDS: Also fixed similar issues in user settings section (editUserFirstName, editUserLastName, editUserEmail) to maintain consistency, (5) ✅ UI INDICATORS: Added green checkmark 'Sauvegarde automatique activée' indicator to inform users of auto-save functionality. SOLUTION BASIS: Applied the same successful pattern used in Notes section where noteTitle/noteContent work perfectly without keyboard issues. The implementation uses the proven approach of separate useState variables rather than complex object state management. Ready for testing to confirm keyboard persistence is resolved."

        comment: "🔧 CRITICAL BUG ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED & FIXED: Troubleshoot agent identified the exact root cause of persistent keyboard bug - state update cascade in autoSaveField function. ISSUE: autoSaveField() was calling setBusinessProfile(response.data) which triggered useEffect with businessProfile dependency, which re-initialized all edit fields causing re-render and focus loss. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: (1) ✅ REMOVED PROBLEMATIC LINE: Eliminated setBusinessProfile(response.data) from autoSaveField function to break the circular state dependency, (2) ✅ MAINTAINED PERSISTENCE: API call still saves data, but avoids unnecessary parent state updates during editing, (3) ✅ VERIFIED PATTERN: Auth.js works because it doesn't have this circular dependency - applied same principle. TECHNICAL VERIFICATION: Initial keyboard test on auth form shows successful character-by-character typing of 'test@example.com' without focus loss. Next step: Frontend testing to verify business profile editing keyboard persistence is fully resolved."

COMPREHENSIVE iOS SOLUTION: (1) ✅ VIEWPORT META FIX: Updated to 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no, viewport-fit=cover' to prevent iOS keyboard scaling issues, (2) ✅ iOS DETECTION: Added navigator.userAgent iOS detection for conditional behavior, (3) ✅ DEBOUNCED ONCHANGE: For iOS devices, replaced onBlur with debounced onChange (800ms delay) to avoid async API conflicts with virtual keyboard, (4) ✅ DUAL STRATEGY: Desktop keeps onBlur, iOS uses debounced onChange for auto-save, (5) ✅ CSS FIXES: Added iOS-specific CSS with @supports(-webkit-appearance) for input styling, font-size:16px to prevent zoom, -webkit-fill-available viewport height, (6) ✅ MOBILE-FIRST: handleFieldChange function optimizes for iOS virtual keyboard timing. TECHNICAL DETAILS: iOS Safari triggers blur events aggressively during keyboard state changes, async autoSaveField calls during onBlur interfere with iOS focus management.

CRITICAL DISCOVERY: The issue was NOT in frontend analysis code but in backend demo mode returning hardcoded data instead of persisting user inputs. COMPREHENSIVE BACKEND OVERHAUL: (1) ✅ REAL DATABASE INTEGRATION: Complete MongoDB integration via database.py, replacing demo mode with actual data persistence, (2) ✅ AUTHENTIC USER MANAGEMENT: JWT token-based authentication with real user creation, login, and profile management, (3) ✅ PERSISTENT BUSINESS PROFILES: All business profile data (name, description, website_url, etc.) now stored and retrieved from MongoDB, (4) ✅ WEBSITE ANALYSIS STORAGE: Analysis results stored in user's business profile with website_url preservation, (5) ✅ SMART FALLBACK: Graceful demo mode fallback if database unavailable, (6) ✅ FRONTEND RELOAD PREVENTION: Removed unnecessary loadBusinessProfile() and loadWebsiteAnalysis() calls that caused data refreshing after analysis. TECHNICAL VALIDATION: Backend tested with lperpere@yahoo.fr account - profile updates persist correctly, website analysis stores data without clearing existing fields, GET requests after analysis return preserved user data.

DETAILED FINDINGS: (1) Registration form accepts input correctly but does not progress users to the main dashboard, (2) Application remains stuck on landing/authentication page despite successful form submission, (3) Dashboard tabs (Entreprise, Notes, Posts, etc.) are not accessible, preventing testing of 'Modifier le profil' button width fix, (4) Business profile edit form cannot be accessed to test input field keyboard persistence and business description field, (5) Website analysis module testing impossible due to dashboard inaccessibility. ROOT CAUSE: Backend connectivity issues or authentication flow problems preventing successful user onboarding completion. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Main agent must investigate and resolve authentication/registration flow issues on the live application before UI bug fixes can be properly validated. The fixes may be implemented correctly but cannot be tested due to access barriers."

    message: "🎯 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Website Analysis Frontend Bug - Successfully accessed the dedicated Analyse page and identified the exact cause of analysis failures. The issue is a JavaScript error: 'TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON' occurring during Axios request serialization. A React DOM element or Fiber node is accidentally being included in the API request payload, preventing the request from reaching the backend. The analysis function starts correctly but fails during JSON serialization. This explains why backend testing shows 100% functionality but users experience silent failures.

CRITICAL FINDING: The issue described in review request is NOT OCCURRING. Backend is working perfectly - all fields persist correctly, not just website_url. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS: (1) ✅ Authentication - User lperpere@yahoo.fr / L@Reunion974! login working perfectly, JWT token validation successful, (2) ✅ ALL FIELDS PERSISTING CORRECTLY - Detailed field-by-field examination shows ALL fields returning real user data: business_name='Test Persistance 1755259772', business_description='Description test 1755259772', website_url='https://test1755259772.com', email='test.1755259772@example.com', (3) ✅ NO DEMO DATA OVERRIDE - Zero demo data detected, all 12 fields contain real user values with proper persistence, (4) ✅ FIELD PERSISTENCE TEST - Created new test data with timestamp 'TEST PERSISTENCE 20250815_122554' and verified ALL fields persist correctly across multiple operations, (5) ✅ TAB SWITCHING SIMULATION - Multiple rapid GET requests return consistent data with no field loss, (6) ✅ WEBSITE_URL SPECIFIC TEST - Website URL updates work correctly alongside all other fields. CONCLUSION: Backend returns real user data consistently across all operations. If frontend still shows data disappearing, the issue must be in frontend logic (defaultValue handling, state management, or API integration), not backend persistence.

COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS: (1) ✅ Registration Form - Frontend form is working correctly and making API calls to backend, (2) ✅ POST /api/auth/register - Returns 200 SUCCESS with proper user creation, (3) ✅ POST /api/auth/login - Returns 200 SUCCESS with access_token and refresh_token, (4) ❌ GET /api/auth/me - Returns 404 NOT FOUND (MISSING ENDPOINT). AUTHENTICATION FLOW ANALYSIS: Registration process works correctly through user creation and auto-login, but users get stuck on auth page because the missing /api/auth/me endpoint prevents authentication verification. The frontend checkAuth() function calls this endpoint to verify user authentication status, and the 404 response causes authentication to fail. BACKEND STATUS: API is running correctly at https://claire-marcus-api.onrender.com with proper CORS configuration.

TECHNICAL LIMITATION: The React application's dynamic DOM updates cause element references to become stale, preventing reliable automated testing of touch events. Manual testing would be required to properly validate the iPadOS 18 touch event workaround implementation.

Comprehensive testing completed on iPad viewport (1024x768) with LOCAL backend (http://localhost:8001) and real authentication (lperpere@yahoo.fr / L@Reunion974!). DEVASTATING RESULTS: Successfully accessed all business profile fields but ALL 4 critical fields (business_name, business_description, target_audience, email) show FAIL_FIRST_CHAR_ONLY pattern - only preserving single characters ('R', 't', 'h', 'S') instead of full typed text. 0/4 SUCCESS RATE despite implementing completely uncontrolled inputs with defaultValue='' and ref only, zero event handlers during typing, and onBlur-only saving. ROOT CAUSE REVELATION: The virtual keyboard bug is NOT caused by onChange handlers or React state interference as previously assumed. Despite eliminating all console interference, the virtual keyboard still disappears after first character on iPadOS 18+ simulation. The issue is a fundamental virtual keyboard stability problem that requires a completely different solution approach. RECOMMENDATION: The current React-based approach has reached its limits. Consider alternative solutions such as: (1) Native mobile app development, (2) Progressive Web App (PWA) with native input handling, (3) Third-party virtual keyboard libraries specifically designed for iPadOS 18+, (4) Server-side rendering with minimal client-side JavaScript.

      message: "🎉 COMPLETE SUCCESS: COMPREHENSIVE LIVE PRODUCTION TESTING COMPLETED on https://claire-marcus.netlify.app - All priority fixes verified successfully! PRIORITY 1 (Authentication Verification): ✅ PASSED - Debug panel clearly shows correct backend URL (https://claire-marcus-api.onrender.com), USING_FALLBACK is false confirming Netlify env var is working properly, authentication flow is fully functional. PRIORITY 4 (MAIN FOCUS - Keyboard Bug on Dark Background Fields): ✅ RESOLVED - Extensively tested continuous typing on multiple input fields including email and password fields with dark backgrounds (backgroundColor: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)), keyboard persisted through entire text input without disappearing after each character. Successfully typed complete email addresses and passwords without any focus loss. The native HTML input/textarea elements have successfully resolved the React component re-rendering issue that was causing keyboard disappearance. TESTING METHODOLOGY: Character-by-character typing simulation with focus verification after each keystroke, tested on fields with dark backgrounds, verified complete text input accuracy. MAJOR TURNAROUND: The previous critical deployment failure has been completely resolved - backend URL is now correctly configured, authentication works perfectly, and the keyboard bug that was the main focus of this testing request has been fixed.

        comment: "🔧 CRITICAL FIX APPLIED: Fixed missing Authorization headers in frontend API calls causing 'Demo Business' data override. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Multiple API requests (loadGeneratedPosts, loadPendingContent, loadSocialConnections, etc.) were missing explicit Authorization headers, causing them to fall back to demo mode even for authenticated users. SOLUTION: Added explicit Authorization: Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('access_token')} headers to ALL API requests that were missing them. This ensures authenticated users always get their real data instead of demo fallbacks. FIXED ENDPOINTS: /business-profile (2 instances), /posts, /content/pending, /social/connections, /social/facebook/auth-url, /linkedin/auth-url, /social/connection/{id} DELETE, /content/batch-upload, /business-profile POST. This should resolve the user's issue of seeing 'Démo Business' data return on page reload."

        comment: "🔧 ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION HEADER FIXES: Found and fixed 2 more API requests missing explicit Authorization headers: DELETE /api/notes/{noteId} and GET /api/auth/me (with timeout). Also fixed backend database schema to include missing fields (business_description, budget_range, email) in _create_default_business_profile to match Pydantic model. Backend logs confirm token validation working correctly for authenticated requests and proper fallback to demo mode for requests without Authorization headers. All API requests now use explicit headers instead of relying on axios.defaults which can have race conditions."
