The trajectory outlines the previous AI engineer's work on the Claire et Marcus PWA, a full-stack application. Initial phases focused on fixing core UI/UX issues like dashboard restoration, header layout, and enabling virtual keyboard input using uncontrolled components. A significant effort was dedicated to robust authentication and persistent data storage. Feature expansion included refining the business profile, overhauling website analysis with GPT-4o, and enhancing the content library with CRUD for notes and multi-selection for media. The most recent and extended work involved integrating Pixabay for royalty-free image search, which exposed and subsequently fixed numerous authentication, display, image processing (EXIF, resizing, caching), and data migration bugs. The engineer then began implementing a complex periodic notes system. The overall approach was iterative, with frequent user feedback and systematic debugging, often relying on the  for complex issues, culminating in a stable Pixabay integration and a partially implemented new notes feature.

<product_requirements>
The Claire et Marcus PWA is an AI-powered SaaS for small businesses to automate social media content and profile management. Core requirements include: reliable content saving, display, and deletion via MongoDB; a 5-column content library grid with pop-up previews and batch operations; automatic 320px WEBP thumbnails; AI-powered website analysis using GPT-4o with monthly re-analysis and detailed outputs; a notes module; persistent business profiles; and robust authentication. Initial work involved restoring the dashboard, header layout, and enabling virtual keyboard input. Subsequent requirements added brand tone and posting frequency dropdowns, a locked/unlocked  system, and design modernization. Critical bug fixes addressed persistent 401 errors, header display, and mobile tab layout. Recent user requests focused on: manual post generation; Pixabay integration for royalty-free images (search, add to library); a visual added feedback (green checkmark) for Pixabay images; responsive Pixabay search layout; French categories for Pixabay; fixing virtual keyboard on Pixabay inputs; resolving all thumbnail/preview loading issues for both uploaded and Pixabay images; correcting image orientation (EXIF); resizing uploaded images to 1024px on the smallest side at 72dpi; optimizing image loading/caching; enabling title editing for photos; full multi-file upload functionality; and a new advanced periodic notes system with a monthly note checkbox, specific month/year assignments, and intelligent sorting/deletion.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: The main React component, central to UI and logic.
    -   **Importance**: Renders the  with all tabs. Heavily modified for Pixabay integration UI (states, functions, sub-tabs, pagination, responsive layout), virtual keyboard compatibility fixes, thumbnail/preview URL generation (with token), and  for image titles. It also handles the states and logic for the new periodic notes system.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added states like , , , , , , , . Pixabay API functions (, ). Logic to include token in thumbnail/file URLs. Responsive adjustments for Pixabay search buttons and Ajouter buttons.  modified for race condition. New states , ,  added for notes.
-   ****: Main stylesheet.
    -   **Importance**: Global styles and component styling.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added mobile/touch CSS for virtual keyboard, animations. Specific CSS rules for notes form fields (, , ) for font size and touch-action. No specific new changes were shown here for Pixabay or notes in the trajectory.
-   ****: Frontend environment variables.
    -   **Importance**: Stores .
    -   **Changes Made**: Corrected  from local Emergent to Render, then back to local Emergent repeatedly to address login/data issues.
-   ****: Authentication component.
    -   **Importance**: Handles user login and registration.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  to the  request to resolve CORS policy errors during authentication.
-   ****: Main FastAPI backend server.
    -   **Importance**: Core API routes and Pydantic models.
    -   **Changes Made**:  model updated with , , .  model added.  and  endpoints implemented/modified (to accept JSON body, use correct collection).  endpoint added for updating content titles.
-   ****: Handles MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Importance**: Database operations.
    -   **Changes Made**:  function modified to accept , ,  parameters.
-   ****: Backend environment variables.
    -   **Importance**: Stores , .
    -   **Changes Made**:  added.  updated multiple times to switch between local and user's external MongoDB Atlas.
-   ****: Python dependencies.
    -   **Importance**: Lists all backend libraries.
    -   **Changes Made**:  confirmed to be present.
-   ****: Handles thumbnail generation.
    -   **Importance**: Image processing, resizing, and EXIF handling.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  function for EXIF rotation.  and  updated to use EXIF.  (moved to  locally later) was created for precise image resizing (1024px on smallest side, 72 DPI, 85% JPEG quality).  was updated to handle UUID strings.
-   ****: Handles file uploads and serving media.
    -   **Importance**: Manages GridFS storage, image resizing, and content delivery.
    -   **Changes Made**:  function added to allow token-based authentication for  endpoint.  function moved inline to prevent circular imports.  logic updated to resize *each* image, apply EXIF, generate correct  and  fields (using UUIDs) before saving to GridFS. Corrected  that broke backend.  called with  (UUID) instead of  (ObjectId).
-   ****: Manages thumbnail specific routes.
    -   **Importance**: Provides endpoints for accessing thumbnails.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into enhancing the content notes module based on new user requirements. The user requested a new system for periodic notes, including:
1.  **Fixing a note editing bug**: The edit button (crayon) required two clicks to populate the fields, and the page should scroll to the editing area upon clicking it.
2.  **Implementing a monthly note system**:
    *   A checkbox note valable tous les mois (note valid every month).
    *   Month and year dropdowns (attribuer cette note Ã ) which are grayed out if the monthly note checkbox is active.
    *   Notes should be sorted: always valid first, then chronologically by month (closest first).
    *   Notes for a specific month should be deleted on the first day of the following month.

The AI engineer has already initiated the implementation of this new feature by:
-   **Correcting the note editing bug in **: The  function was modified to address the race condition, ensuring  and  updates correctly populate the note fields on the first click and scroll to the top.
-   **Modifying the backend model ( in )**: Added new fields: , , .
-   **Updating the note creation/update function in **: Modified  (and implicitly ) to accept and store these new periodic note fields.

The current activity is at the very beginning of the frontend implementation for the new periodic notes system, specifically at the point of adding the new input fields (checkbox, month, year dropdowns) to the note form in .
