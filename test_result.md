# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

RECOMMENDATION: Implement password reset functionality or ask user to try remembering their original password. The authentication system is working correctly - this is a user-specific password issue, not a system problem."

    message: "🔍 LOGIN API RESPONSE STRUCTURE INVESTIGATION COMPLETED: Comprehensive investigation of /api/auth/login response structure completed successfully. TESTED USERS: (1) lperpere@yahoo.fr with password 'L@Reunion974!' - LOGIN SUCCESSFUL, (2) admin@postcraft.com with password 'admin123' - LOGIN SUCCESSFUL. RESPONSE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS: Both users return IDENTICAL response structures with exactly 3 fields: 'access_token', 'refresh_token', 'token_type'. FIELD VERIFICATION: (1) ✅ access_token: PRESENT - JWT token for authentication, (2) ✅ refresh_token: PRESENT - JWT token for token refresh, (3) ✅ token_type: PRESENT - Value is 'bearer', (4) ❌ token: MISSING - No generic 'token' field, (5) ❌ user: MISSING - No user object in response. TOKEN FUNCTIONALITY CONFIRMED: Both access tokens work correctly with authenticated endpoints (/api/auth/me returns proper user data). FRONTEND RECOMMENDATIONS: (1) Use 'access_token' field for authentication token, (2) Use 'refresh_token' field for token refresh, (3) Use 'token_type' field for token type (value: 'bearer'). The login API response structure is consistent and working correctly - frontend should use 'access_token' NOT 'token' for authentication."
