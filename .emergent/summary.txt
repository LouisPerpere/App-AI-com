The trajectory details an iterative development process where the previous AI engineer evolved an AI-powered SaaS PWA. Initially, the focus was on restoring the dashboard, fixing frontend layout issues (header, virtual keyboard compatibility), and establishing basic backend functionality for business profile management. A significant recurring challenge was the  authentication errors, often due to a desynchronized or reset database state on the deployed environment, necessitating repeated user account re-creations.

As core functionality solidified, the work shifted towards feature enhancements and significant UI/UX improvements. This included the implementation of new business profile fields (brand tone, posting frequency), the evolution of input field interaction from basic auto-save to a sophisticated locked/unlocked editing system, and a major overhaul of the website analysis module to use multi-page GPT-4o with highly detailed outputs and automated scheduling. A substantial design modernization was also undertaken, incorporating glassmorphism, animations, and responsive elements. The latest interactions highlight a continued cycle of fine-tuning UI elements (header, tabs, margins) and addressing outstanding issues in the Notes and Library sections, indicating an ongoing commitment to user feedback and polish.

The Claire et Marcus PWA is an AI-powered SaaS for small businesses, automating social media content and profile management. It needs reliable content saving, display, and deletion via MongoDB, a 5-column content library grid with pop-up previews and batch operations, automatic 320px WEBP thumbnails, AI-powered website analysis using GPT-4o, a notes module, persistent business profiles, and robust authentication. The infrastructure is being migrated towards autonomy with Emergent. The immediate goal was to restore the full application interface and functionality, including a working dashboard, correct header layout, and functional virtual keyboard input.

Subsequent requirements included:
- Adding ton de marque (brand tone) and rythme de publications (posting frequency) fields with dropdowns.
- Implementing an intuitive editing system (initially auto-save, then locked fields with explicit edit/save/cancel buttons).
- Enhancing website analysis to be multi-page, ignore technical content, provide highly detailed outputs (summary, audience, services, content suggestions, keywords), feature automatic monthly re-analysis, display last/next analysis dates, and persist the analyzed URL.
- Modernizing the overall design with an animated background, glassmorphism, vibrant colors, and dynamic interactive elements.
- Resolving recurring 401 login errors, fixing header display issues (text visibility, layout, breathing effect), improving mobile tab layout (2 lines, 4 per line, no overflow), and addressing bugs in the Notes (priority dropdown, French translation, save/display) and Library (thumbnail display, size, style) pages.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack**: React.js (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB/GridFS (database).
- **Authentication**: JWT,  for tokens, ,  for password hashing, user registration/login.
- **AI Integration**: GPT-4o (via  library) for website analysis.
- **Frontend UI/UX**: Responsive design, virtual keyboard compatibility,  component, Tailwind CSS, Glassmorphism, CSS animations.
- **API Interaction**: RESTful endpoints,  prefix for Kubernetes ingress.
- **Scheduled Tasks**:  for automated website analysis.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: The main React component.
    -   **Importance**: Central hub for UI, logic, and backend interaction. It renders the  with all tabs and their functionalities.
    -   **Changes Made**: Underwent significant restoration and modifications. Fixed a bug where  wasn't returned. Refactored header for layout, logout, and added a breathing effect. Implemented robust virtual keyboard handling for mobile inputs. Integrated  and  dropdowns. Replaced auto-save with a new  component that provides locked/unlocked editing with specific icons. Enhanced website analysis display, dates, and a smart re-analysis button. Global design updated with animated background, glassmorphism, and modern tabs/buttons. Moved edit buttons to the right, adjusted header text colors, and restructured mobile tab layout for 2 lines. URL persistence for analysis was improved.
-   ****: Main stylesheet.
    -   **Importance**: Defines global styles and component-specific styling.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added mobile/touch-specific CSS for virtual keyboard, corrected syntax. Introduced , , , ,  animations for modern design.
-   ****: Frontend environment variables.
    -   **Importance**: Stores  for backend API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated  multiple times based on deployment environments (Emergent preview, Render.com).
-   ****: Main FastAPI backend server.
    -   **Importance**: Defines core API routes for authentication, user management, and business profile operations.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  enum. Implemented a  endpoint for user registration, including email validation,  password hashing, and JWT token generation. Adjusted authentication logic to correctly handle password hash storage.
-   ****: AI-powered website analysis module.
    -   **Importance**: Responsible for crawling, processing, and generating detailed website analyses using an LLM.
    -   **Changes Made**: Enhanced to perform multi-page analysis (identifying key content pages, ignoring technical ones). The GPT prompt was significantly improved to generate much more detailed summaries, target audience descriptions, main services, content suggestions, and keywords. Integrated  to use GPT-4o, including fixing import paths and ensuring the LLM key is correctly accessed. The prompt was refined to ensure the business name is extracted without including domain extensions.
-   ****: Backend scheduler for automated tasks.
    -   **Importance**: Manages background jobs.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  function to automatically re-analyze websites monthly, ensuring up-to-date analysis data.
-   ** (temporary)** and ** (temporary)**: Debugging scripts.
    -   **Importance**:  was used to directly add/update users in MongoDB for testing purposes during authentication issues.  was used to isolate and test bcrypt hashing and login logic.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Notes page**: Modify the priority field to a dropdown menu, translate relevant UI elements to French, and fix the ajouter la note functionality (notes are not saving or appearing).
-   **Library page**: Resolve the issue where uploaded photo thumbnails are not displayed. Implement smaller, square thumbnails with pointed corners, displaying 5 photos per line, in an iPhone-like grid layout.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was diligently addressing multiple UI/UX issues and functional bugs reported by the user. The primary focus was on polishing the frontend interface and resolving outstanding problems that emerged after significant design modernization and feature additions.

The engineer has successfully:
1.  **Rectified Header Display**: The header text Claire redige, Marcus programme, vous respirez has been restored to its intended violet color, and the breathing animation effect is applied. This addresses the user's feedback about text being masked and the gradient color.
2.  **Improved Mobile Tab Layout**: The tab styling has been adjusted to prevent overflow on mobile devices, ensuring that the 2-line, 4-tabs-per-line structure is always visible. This involved reducing font size for tab labels and making the active tab's highlight less rounded to optimize space and appearance.
3.  **Moved Edit Buttons**: The edit, save, and cancel buttons within the  component have been relocated to the right of the input fields. This prevents them from obscuring the text being edited, enhancing the user experience.

The current activity is focused on the **Notes page**. The engineer has just located the relevant section in  (around line 1516) and is poised to implement the required changes. These changes include transforming the priority field into a dropdown menu, translating necessary text to French, and crucially, fixing the bug that prevents new notes from being saved and displayed in Mes notes. This work is the next step in addressing the comprehensive list of user feedback from Chat Message 496.
