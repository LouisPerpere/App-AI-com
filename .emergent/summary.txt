The AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing core application functionalities like social media integrations and content management, while iteratively implementing new features. Initial efforts resolved Facebook/Instagram OAuth conflicts, persistent URL bloquée errors, and phantom posts through dedicated s, correct redirect URIs, and persistent connection saving. A major effort addressed the 0/22 items displayed in the media library, diagnosing and fixing obsolete media URLs, authentication issues (missing bearer tokens), and critical React timing errors. Post-generation logic was enhanced with proportional calculation and platform-specific usage marking. An attempt to implement a full calendar UI and manual scheduling led to compilation errors, prompting a rollback to a stable state. The trajectory concludes with the AI re-addressing the Valider button's behavior and the manual date/time modification feature, focusing on a more modular implementation without the full calendar.

The Claire et Marcus PWA aims to automate social media content, generating Instagram calendars with AI visuals/text using business profiles, website analysis, user uploads, and notes. Key features include post modification, diverse visuals, carousel support, and monthly content sections. Initial fixes addressed Instagram integration, migration to Facebook Login for Business, photo management, and OpenAI/Claude LLM integration. Subsequent requests involved fixing connecté undefined, phantom posts, incorrect generation month, adding a post delete button, resolving image display issues (grey placeholder), and debugging Facebook/Instagram authentication errors (Invalid Scopes, URL bloquée). The user provided dedicated Facebook and Instagram Config IDs. Later, requests included refining post generation (proportional, next-day scheduling, last-day blocking, per-network generation), an intelligent calendar UI with post validation and filters, and manual date/time modification for posts.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Main FastAPI application.
    -   **Importance**: Orchestrates all backend interactions, API routes, authentication, and social media callbacks.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Facebook/Instagram OAuth logic: Separated  usage, updated to dedicated  and .
        -   Facebook callback: Modified to persist user social connections in MongoDB.
        -   Media handling:  endpoint updated to fix obsolete image URLs ( to ) and include platform-specific usage data.
        -   Post generation:  modified to accept connected platforms, calculate proportional posts based on remaining days, and schedule posts from the day after generation.
        -   Debug endpoints: Added , , , , , . Most were temporary and later removed.
        -   Temporal  added for frontend debugging.
-   ****: Manages AI-driven social media post generation.
    -   **Importance**: Generates tailored posts using LLMs.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   : Updated to accept  and use them in post generation logic.
        -   : Modified to mark media usage per social media platform.
        -   : Modified to schedule posts from the day *after* generation, instead of the 1st of the month.
-   ****: Stores backend environment variables.
    -   **Importance**: Critical for configuration (DB URL, API keys, redirect URIs).
    -   **Changes Made**:  and  were introduced.  was temporarily switched between  and  to align with Facebook Developer Console.
-   ****: Main React component.
    -   **Importance**: Manages UI state, renders posts, handles user interactions like social connection and image upload.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Image display:  updated to ensure authentication token is sent correctly, and  variable is correctly populated.
        -   Critical bug fix:  calling  moved after function definition to resolve  error.
        -   Post generation:  modified to check for connected networks and display popups.
        -   Media display: Replaced general used check with platform-specific badges.
        -    in  was adjusted to match backend's expectations for different environments.
        -   *Temporary changes for calendar and manual scheduling were rolled back.*
        -    modified to add a button for manual date/time modification.
-   ****: Stores frontend environment variables.
    -   **Importance**: Critical for backend URL configuration.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was modified multiple times to address connectivity issues and align with Facebook's domain restrictions, eventually pointing to , then temporarily to , and finally back to  (as of the last consistent state).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had successfully restored the application to a stable state after encountering critical compilation errors () during the implementation of a comprehensive calendar UI and manual scheduling feature. The problematic code for the calendar UI and manual scheduling was reverted using a HEAD is now at 85fd8f79 auto-commit for e4ee7228-3fbd-4396-a763-54357d8a3eae to a previously stable commit ().

The user confirmed that the application was working well again, with Facebook and Instagram connections functional, the media library displaying content, and post generation logic (proportional, next-day scheduling) operational.

The user's most recent request was to refine the Valider button behavior, specifically:
1.  Remove the popup that asks to choose a social network, as the post already specifies the network.
2.  Ensure the Valider function considers the post's date and time for scheduling.
3.  Re-add a function to manually modify the publication date and time on each post, without involving AI.

The AI engineer's current actions involve addressing these three points. The last action taken was to begin adding a button for manual date/time modification within the  component in .
