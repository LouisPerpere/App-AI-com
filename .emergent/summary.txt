<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully transitioned PostCraft from a basic MVP to a sophisticated PWA SaaS. Initial work focused on fulfilling user requests for UI/UX enhancements, including removing AI mentions, refining marketing copy, and redesigning navigation. Core functionalities like content upload (Notes and Bibliothèque) were restored and improved for user experience. Significant backend development included implementing a robust AI-powered analytics system (Phases 1-3) capable of analyzing post performance, optimizing content generation prompts, and integrating with the scheduler for adaptive content creation. Key features like a dynamic subscription modal with tiered plan enforcement and anti-abuse measures (preventing multiple free trials) were also implemented. Debugging involved resolving frontend rendering issues, fixing broken navigation links, and addressing ESLint errors. The trajectory concludes with the AI mid-task, working on a comprehensive profile editing feature and the dynamic display of the subscription pop-up based on user activity and subscription status.

PostCraft is a PWA SaaS designed to automate social media for small businesses and freelancers. It allows users to set up a business profile (with AI recommendations), upload diverse content (photos, videos, text, batch uploads, deferred descriptions), and receive AI-generated monthly publication calendars. The AI ensures unique, non-repetitive content without ChatGPT markers. Users validate/modify posts before automated publishing to Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Features include periodic content generation, upload reminders, fallback generic content, and logo branding. Essential elements are user authentication and a comprehensive SaaS back office for client, subscription, and payment management (Stripe, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal). Recently, the user requested new subscription plans (1-month free; Starter: €14.99/month, 4 posts/month, 1 network; Rocket: €29.99/month, unlimited posts, all networks; Pro: €199.99/month, unlimited posts, multi-accounts). A website analysis feature (with ChatGPT) for content generation, including quarterly analysis and manual re-analysis, was also implemented. The application's UI was refined for a sexy marketing aesthetic, emphasizing time-saving benefits over automation. Crucially, a smart paywall system with conditional pop-ups and feature blocking based on subscription status was introduced, alongside measures to prevent multiple free trials. The user also requested all elements in the business profile be editable and that the subscription pop-up logic be dynamic based on the selected publication rhythm.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on two related user requests:
1.  **Enabling full editability of the Business Profile:** The user reported that the Modifier button in the business profile did not allow editing all elements. The AI engineer discovered that the button was incorrectly linked to the website analysis modal. The current task involves creating an  state to control the visibility of an editable form for the business profile. The AI has successfully added this state and has started to identify the conditional logic needed to switch between the display view and the full editing form. The last action was examining the  file to find the appropriate location for implementing this conditional rendering.
2.  **Refining Subscription Pop-up Logic:** The user requested that the subscription pop-up appear after the avant-dernier post validé (second-to-last validated post), dynamically based on the user's selected publication rhythm (e.g., 3rd post out of 4 per month). The AI has started addressing this by adjusting the pop-up display logic, likely by integrating the user's  and  into the  function.

The trajectory ends with the AI mid-search in  to implement the  logic.
