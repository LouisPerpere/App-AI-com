The AI engineer's work focused on restoring the Claire et Marcus PWA dashboard. Key issues tackled included:
1.  **Dashboard Restoration**: Initial attempts to restore  were problematic, leading to a white screen and simplified UI. The user provided the full  (Chat 50), which was then systematically integrated.
2.  **Backend URL Configuration**: An initial  update with an incorrect Emergent preview URL caused backend test failures. User confirmation (Chat 56) led to switching to .
3.  **Frontend Layout/Functionality**:
    *   Fixed a critical bug where the  component was defined but not returned by  (Chat 89-93).
    *   Addressed user feedback on header layout, making the logout button discrete and rearranging text (Chat 103-110).
    *   Resolved the persistent virtual keyboard issue across mobile/tablet devices by using native HTML inputs, specialized CSS, and explicit mobile-specific attributes (, , ). This involved several iterations, including creating a dedicated test page and integrating tests into the dashboard.
4.  **Content Management**: The  restoration includes components for content upload, display, and deletion, and a notes module.
5.  **Current State**: All dashboard tabs are functional, header is correct, and virtual keyboard works for all input fields. The immediate pending tasks are to implement saving logic for the business profile fields and add a brand tone selection.

<product_requirements>
The Claire et Marcus PWA is an AI-powered SaaS for small businesses, automating social media content and profile management. Core features include reliable content saving, display, and deletion via MongoDB, a 5-column content library grid with pop-up previews and batch operations, automatic 320px WEBP thumbnails (supporting HEIC/HEIF), AI-powered website analysis with GPT-5, a notes module for content generation, persistent business profiles, and a robust authentication flow across all browsers. The application's infrastructure is meant to be autonomous, initially migrating from Emergent.sh to Render.com/Netlify, and then back to Emergent infrastructure. The immediate goal was to restore the full application interface and functionality to its previous complete state, including fixing dashboard display, header layout, and enabling virtual keyboard input for all editable fields.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack**: React.js (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB/GridFS (database).
- **Authentication**: JWT,  for tokens,  for API calls, cross-origin requests ().
- **Media Processing**: Thumbnail generation, image/video uploads to GridFS.
- **Frontend UI/UX**: Responsive design, virtual keyboard compatibility (iOS/Android specific CSS, native inputs,  handling, ), component re-rendering optimization (, ), state management.
- **API Interaction**: RESTful endpoints,  prefix for routing.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: The main React component and frontend logic hub.
    -   **Importance**: Orchestrates the entire UI, user interactions, and communication with the backend. It defines the main  component which renders the  with all its tabs and functionalities.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file underwent significant modifications:
        1.  Initial extensive modifications were lost due to a placeholder.
        2.  User provided the full original content, which was then restored.
        3.  A critical bug ( component not being returned by ) was fixed by adding .
        4.  Header layout was refactored for better display and a more discreet logout button.
        5.  Introduced a robust virtual keyboard detection () and handling mechanism using  for input elements,  saves, and specific mobile-optimized native HTML input/textarea elements with attributes like , , .
        6.  Editable fields were added and optimized in the Entreprise, Analyse, and Notes tabs for mobile input.
        7.  A temporary virtual keyboard test section was created in  (then deleted) and integrated into the Entreprise tab (then also deleted after verification).
-   ****: Main stylesheet for the frontend.
    -   **Importance**: Defines global styles and component-specific styling.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added specific CSS rules for mobile/touch devices to enhance virtual keyboard functionality, including rules for , , and . Multiple syntax errors (extraneous braces) were identified and corrected during the process.
-   ****: Environment variables for the frontend.
    -   **Importance**: Stores critical configuration like the backend URL.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially updated with a user-provided Emergent preview URL, then corrected to  based on user feedback and backend testing.
-   ****: Testing and communication log.
    -   **Importance**: Documents testing outcomes and agent communications.
    -   **Changes Made**: Continuously updated to reflect backend and frontend testing results, including white screen bug, header fixes, and virtual keyboard status.

<pending_tasks>
- Apply essential, targeted corrections to the user-provided, fully restored  content. (Ongoing - saving logic, new field)
- Implement saving logic for the newly added editable profile fields in the Entreprise tab.
- Add a ton de marque (brand tone) field with a dropdown selection in the Entreprise tab.
- Deploy the corrected frontend and the compatible backend to the Emergent preview environment for full testing.
- Complete full implementation and testing of the SaaS back office (client, subscription, payment management).
- Fully enable and test backend modules like  and .
- Configure and test advanced social media integrations.
- Ensure Notes module correctly displays notes after saving.
- Finalize the migration to Emergent infrastructure.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed a critical user-reported issue where the virtual keyboard was not appearing on mobile/tablet devices for input fields in the dashboard. This involved:
1.  Integrating a dedicated virtual keyboard test section into the Entreprise tab of the dashboard (later removed).
2.  Applying specific mobile-optimized CSS in  (e.g., , , ).
3.  Refactoring input fields in the Notes, Analyse, and Entreprise tabs to use native HTML  and  elements with appropriate mobile-specific attributes and  for value management, especially for devices with virtual keyboards.
4.  Correcting multiple CSS syntax errors in  that caused compilation failures.

After successfully resolving the virtual keyboard issue for all editable fields, the AI engineer proceeded to enable editing for the business profile fields in the Entreprise tab, also applying the keyboard optimizations. However, the user reported that the save buttons for these newly editable fields do not function, and changes are not persistent. Additionally, the user requested a new ton de marque (brand tone) field with a dropdown menu. The AI engineer has acknowledged these two issues and was in the process of adding the necessary state variables to implement the brand tone field and the associated saving logic.

<optional_next_step>
Implement the saving logic for the Entreprise profile fields and add the ton de marque field with a dropdown, as requested by the user.
