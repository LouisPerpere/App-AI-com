The trajectory details the iterative development of an AI-powered SaaS PWA. Initially, the focus was on critical UI/UX fixes: restoring the dashboard, resolving header layout, and making virtual keyboard input functional across various components. Authentication issues, often linked to database resets, were a persistent challenge, necessitating backend adjustments.

The previous AI engineer then systematically enhanced core features. This included adding business profile fields (, ), refining input interactions to a locked/unlocked  component, and a major overhaul of the website analysis module to leverage multi-page GPT-4o with automated monthly scheduling. Design modernization with glassmorphism and animations was also a significant effort. Recurring issues, particularly the virtual keyboard closing on iPhone bug, were addressed through multiple iterations, finally resolved by converting controlled inputs to uncontrolled inputs with . The notes module received full CRUD functionality and UI polish. The content library gained multi-selection, mass deletion, and an image preview modal with context editing. Most recently, the posts generation tab was built out, offering manual generation with a confirmation workflow. The work is currently focused on integrating Pixabay for external image search and management.

<product_requirements>
The Claire et Marcus PWA is an AI-powered SaaS designed for small businesses to automate social media content and profile management. Key requirements included: reliable content saving, display, and deletion via MongoDB; a 5-column content library grid with pop-up previews and batch operations; automatic 320px WEBP thumbnails; AI-powered website analysis using GPT-4o; a notes module; persistent business profiles; and robust authentication. Initial work focused on restoring the dashboard, fixing header layout, and enabling virtual keyboard input. Subsequent requirements involved adding brand tone and posting frequency dropdowns, implementing a locked/unlocked  system, enhancing multi-page AI website analysis with monthly re-analysis and detailed outputs, and modernizing the design with animations and glassmorphism. Critical bug fixes included persistent 401 login errors, header display, mobile tab layout, and full CRUD functionality with UI/UX improvements for the Notes and Library sections. Most recently, the user requested manual post generation and Pixabay integration for royalty-free images within the content library.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was implementing the Pixabay integration. This was requested by the user to allow the system to fetch royalty-free images to complement user uploads, and for users to manually select images for post generation.

The engineer has successfully:
1.  **Added Pixabay API Key**: The provided Pixabay API key () has been securely added to the backend's  file.
2.  **Integrated Backend Endpoints**: New API endpoints related to Pixabay search and image download have been added to the backend's  file. These endpoints will handle communication with the Pixabay API.

The current activity is at the very beginning of the Pixabay implementation, specifically at the point of ensuring all necessary backend dependencies are in place. The engineer has just started adding  to  to support asynchronous file operations, which will likely be used for handling image downloads from Pixabay. The next step is to complete this dependency update before moving on to the frontend implementation of the Pixabay search and integration UI.
