The AI engineer successfully built a PWA SaaS SocialGénie (now PostCraft) from scratch, focusing on social media content automation. The development was iterative, starting with core AI content generation, then UI enhancements, automation, and recently, authentication and back-office foundations. A major recent focus was integrating Facebook/Instagram APIs and redesigning the frontend for a sexy marketing-oriented look, removing AI mentions. The engineer tackled multiple JSX syntax errors in  during UI redesign, repeatedly debugging and attempting fixes, culminating in a persistent issue with an unclosed tag that required reconstructing parts of the file. The process involved direct user interaction for API keys and feature prioritization, demonstrating adaptability and a user-centric approach.

<product_requirements>
The product, PostCraft, is a PWA SaaS for small businesses and freelancers to automate social media. It requires business profile setup with AI recommendations, content upload (photos/videos with audio/text comments, batch upload, deferred description), and AI analysis to propose a monthly publication calendar, ensuring unique, non-repetitive content without ChatGPT markers. Notifications alert users for ready posts, allowing validation/modification via a carousel. Validated posts are automatically published to selected social networks (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn). The app includes periodic content generation and reminders for content upload, with fallback generic content if insufficient. Branding features include logo upload. Core functionalities also encompass user authentication (login/signup) and a comprehensive SaaS back office for client, subscription, and payment (Stripe, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal) management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was heavily focused on enhancing the frontend UI/UX and ensuring the stability of the recently integrated Facebook/Instagram features.

The previous core task involved completing the comprehensive authentication system (user login/registration, JWT tokens, route protection) and initiating the SaaS back office foundation (creating  and  backend modules and integrating an initial admin dashboard view in ).

Following this, the engineer successfully implemented and thoroughly tested the backend for Facebook/Instagram integration. This included setting up OAuth, handling API calls for pages and posts, and managing tokens. The frontend  was then updated to restore the full multi-tab interface (Upload, Posts, Notes, Calendar, Social), which was inadvertently simplified during earlier development.

The most recent work revolved around a major UI/UX overhaul, as requested by the user, to make the application sexy and marketing-oriented, and to remove all AI mentions. This involved:
1.  Renaming the Upload tab to Bibliothèque and implementing an iPhone-like photo gallery with clickable thumbnails and a modal for adding contextual descriptions to images.
2.  Reordering tabs: Bibliothèque, Notes, Posts, Calendar, Social.
3.  Applying new, vibrant styles defined in  to  and other components, removing AI/IA references throughout the frontend.

During this UI/UX redesign, the engineer encountered persistent JSX syntax errors, primarily . Multiple attempts were made to identify and fix these errors by examining  and checking supervisor logs. The last action was to attempt to fix a persistent JSX error by replacing the  file with a  version. The user then interrupted, reminding the engineer to fully resolve the error before changing focus.

The next step is to verify that the persistent JSX error in  has been completely resolved and the UI is fully functional as intended after the last file replacement.
