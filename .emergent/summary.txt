The AI engineer's work primarily focused on building and refining the Claire et Marcus PWA's core social media post generation feature. This involved extensive backend development for AI integration, content management, and API endpoints, alongside a significant overhaul of the frontend UI for displaying, modifying, and attaching visuals to posts. Key challenges included debugging persistent API key issues (Emergent vs. OpenAI), ensuring content was correctly linked by ID for display, optimizing AI prompts for natural language and content variety, and addressing UI/UX flow for post management and image attachments. The trajectory highlights a methodical approach, with iterative testing, error diagnosis, and feature expansion from a basic generation system to a robust content calendar with image linking and management capabilities.

<product_requirements>
The Claire et Marcus PWA automates social media for small businesses. Initial features included content CRUD, library, thumbnails, AI website analysis, notes, and authentication. User requirements during this trajectory focused on:
1.  **Monthly Organization**: Content and notes in collapsible, 6-month chronological sections.
2.  **Flexible Uploads**: Unified upload button with multi-month and carousel options.
3.  **Enhanced Pixabay**: Custom title/context, tags from context, month attribution.
4.  **UI/UX**: Consistent buttons, reduced margins, enlarged thumbnails, repositioned Pixabay badge.
5.  **Video Playback & Compression**: Correct video playback and 720p compression on upload.
6.  **Post Generation (Core)**: Create an Instagram publication calendar based on business profile, website analysis, uploads, and notes. Posts need visual, text, day/time. Must balance content types, prioritize target audiences, avoid AI-generated language and excessive emojis, and adapt the number of posts to the . Users need to modify generated posts and attach visuals to posts missing them, including direct uploads or selecting from library/Pixabay. Images used should be marked.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack**: React.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB/GridFS (Database).
-   **State Management**: , , .
-   **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints,  (frontend),  (backend).
-   **Image/Video Processing**:  for compression and streaming.
-   **LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o (via  then direct API).
-   **Data Handling**: MongoDB UUIDs for IDs.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main FastAPI application handling API routes.
    -   **Changes Made**: Integrated  endpoints for generation () and retrieval (). Added  for post text modification. Added  for batch content deletion. Implemented  to change . Added  for linking visuals. Logic for determining  from business profile's  was incorporated.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles file uploads and content retrieval.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented HTTP Range header support for video streaming. Added video compression logic.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Importance**: Houses core AI post generation logic.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initialized, then refactored to use a single global ChatGPT request per month (instead of per-post). Enhanced AI prompts with full business context, website analysis, and strict rules against AI-generated language/excessive emojis. Removed fixed content strategy, allowing ChatGPT to decide. Corrected visual ID handling (from  to , then from MongoDB  to GridFS /UUIDs). Added logic to mark images as . Implemented  model with  (/). Adjusted parsing to retain all generated posts, even those missing initial visuals.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central React component, managing UI and state.
    -   **Changes Made**: Major overhaul of the Posts tab UI to monthly collapsible sections with  vignettes and  for detailed view. Implemented dynamic modification buttons and input. Duplicated Uploader X fichiers button. Fixed image display by constructing absolute URLs with authentication tokens. Added  for content movement, . Implemented visual cues for post status ( vs. ). Added image attachment modal () that reuses existing Pixabay and upload components.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Frontend environment variables.
    -   **Changes Made**:  confirmed.  and  were managed here.

<pending_tasks>
-   Fix the JavaScript error  within the  component.
-   Complete the full functionality of the image attachment modal (Library, Pixabay, Upload tabs).
-   Ensure direct uploads from the modal automatically link to the current month.
-   Confirm/complete the display of green check badges on *all* used images in the main content library.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the final stages of implementing the **image attachment feature for generated posts**. This feature allows users to link visuals to posts that were generated without them (marked ⚠️ Image requise). The goal is to provide a comprehensive modal interface, similar to the existing content library and Pixabay integration, where users can:
1.  Select an existing image from their library.
2.  Search and select an image from Pixabay.
3.  Directly upload a new image/video.

The work so far includes:
*   Backend endpoint () to link an image to a post.
*   Modification of the  model to include a  field ( or ).
*   Tracking of image usage () in the backend.
*   Frontend  components visually differentiate posts with and without images (green/orange borders, Ajouter image icon).
*   A new  state and  function to control the modal.
*   The  component was created to house the modal's internal logic and reuse existing components.

The immediate problem is a JavaScript error () occurring when the  modal is opened, indicating a scope or prop passing issue for the Pixabay search function within this new component.
