The previous AI engineer's work involved an iterative process of feature implementation, debugging, and refinement. Key achievements included establishing initial social media integrations, fixing persistent authentication and content display issues, and enhancing post generation logic. A significant portion of the trajectory focused on developing a manual date/time modification feature for posts, including a modern UI and backend endpoint, followed by extensive debugging of button functionality and state management. The Valider button's behavior was a recurring challenge, evolving from simple validation to requiring full integration with a calendar, visual feedback, and persistent state. Backend issues (e.g.,  vs ) were diagnosed and resolved by a sub-agent. The work culminated in the user requesting a read-only mode for validated posts, leading to the removal of modification options and introduction of status badges. The engineer meticulously used debug alerts and screenshots, adapting to user feedback for a stable and intuitive application.

The Claire et Marcus PWA automates social media content generation using AI visuals/text, business profiles, website analysis, user uploads, and notes. Initially, the core problem involved stabilizing Instagram integration, migrating to Facebook Login for Business, fixing content management issues (e.g., 0/22 items displayed, URL bloquée, phantom posts), and integrating LLMs. Subsequent requirements focused on:
- Refining post generation (proportional, next-day scheduling, per-network generation).
- Implementing manual date/time modification for posts via a popup with a calendar and spinners, with specific limits (min 10 min after now, max end of next month), later clarified to be based on the post's attributed month.
- Enhancing the Valider button: remove social network selection popup, use post's date/time, provide visual validation feedback (red for invalid, spinner, Validé! state).
- Improving the calendar UI: clear filter labels, condensed statistics, correct layout, and the ability to view, move, and cancel scheduled posts directly from the calendar.
- Forcing a read-only mode for validated posts: all modification functions/buttons (in both the post thumbnail and preview modal) should be disabled or removed and replaced by a Programmé badge.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Development**: React.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 (Facebook/Instagram Graph API), JWT tokens.
- **State Management**: React , , .
- **UI Components**: Modals, , , toast notifications.
- **API Interaction**: Fetching and posting data to FastAPI endpoints.
- **Deployment**: Supervisor (for service control), Kubernetes Ingress rules.

<code_architecture>

- ****: Main FastAPI application.
    - **Importance**: Handles all backend logic, API routes, and database interactions.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Added  to update post's scheduled date/time.
        - Created  to move a post in the calendar.
        - Created  to remove a post from the calendar and revert its status.
        - Corrected a bug in  where it was querying by  instead of  in MongoDB.
        - The  endpoint now updates the original post's  status in the database.
- ****: Main React component.
    - **Importance**: Manages frontend UI, state, and user interactions. Contains  and  components.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - : Modified to remove popup for social network selection, ensure correct  object is passed, and update post's  state locally. Added spinner and  status.
        - : Updated to use a modern modal with  and , replacing . Integrated  for month-based date range validation.
        -  component: Added a button (initially amber, later green/orange based on validation) for manual date/time modification, which dynamically calculates date limits based on . Logic to hide/show buttons based on  state was continuously refined, eventually leading to full removal/replacement for validated posts.
        -  component: Modified to pass the correct  object to  handler. Conditioned buttons (Valider, Déplacer, Annuler) based on  and  states. Updated to a read-only view for validated posts.
        - Calendar UI: Redesigned the calendar tab to condense statistics, clarify filter labels (Tous réseaux, Tous statuts), and organize controls.
        - Calendar posts: Made clickable to open , passed  prop.
        - Added various temporary debug alerts and visual indicators (red buttons, red badges, debug modals) throughout the development process to diagnose issues.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement the analytics dashboard for published posts.
- Diagnose and fix carousel deletion (if still present).
- Diagnose and fix recurring photo modification issue (blue question mark).
- Work with infrastructure team to resolve any remaining external proxy/cache issues.
- Finalize carousel display logic (grey placeholder instead of first image).
- Continue to apply and verify all corrections on the LIVE environment.
- Ensure the Valider button's state persists correctly (it reverts to Valider when modal is closed/reopened).
- Ensure calendar posts are consistently clickable to open the modal without needing to click other tabs first.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a user request for a read-only mode for validated posts. The user reported issues with the Valider button's state not persisting and calendar posts not being consistently clickable to open the preview modal.

The AI engineer's current work involves:
1.  **Implementing Read-Only Mode for Validated Posts**: This involves modifying frontend components to disable or remove all modification functionalities for posts that have been marked as .
    *   ****:
        *   ****: The engineer is in the process of removing all action buttons (edit image, edit text, delete) and date modification buttons when  is true. These are being replaced with a simple Programmé badge. (Chat Message 362-374)
        *   ****: The engineer has replaced the entire Actions section in the modal with a simplified read-only view, displaying only the title, text, image, scheduled date/time, and a Programmé label when  is true. (Chat Message 375-376)
2.  **Addressing Persistent Issues**: While implementing the read-only mode, the engineer noted that the previous issues of the Valider button reverting state and calendar posts not opening the modal were still present. The engineer added a very visible  to diagnose these persistent modal rendering issues for calendar posts. (Chat Message 353-355, 359)

The trajectory ends with the implementation of the read-only mode in progress, specifically the removal of buttons and adjustment of the modal's content for validated posts.
