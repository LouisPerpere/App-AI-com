The trajectory details an iterative development process by the previous AI engineer to build and stabilize the Claire et Marcus PWA. The initial focus was on migrating content data to a persistent MongoDB from an ephemeral filesystem, resolving data synchronization and reappearing content issues. This involved extensive backend refactoring and frontend state management adjustments. Following this, a thumbnail generation system was introduced, which exposed complex challenges including HEIC/HEIF support, asynchronous task execution, and corrupted file handling.

A significant portion of the work revolved around a persistent authentication flow problem, initially manifesting as users being stuck on onboarding forms or encountering demo user data. This required robust JWT implementation and the creation of a shared  module to ensure consistent authentication across all backend endpoints. Throughout the trajectory, there's a recurring theme of fixes being applied but then reverting or new issues emerging, particularly with  URL configurations and database synchronization between local and production environments, leading to user data loss and disappearing thumbnails. The latest interactions confirm the recurrence of object Object errors in website analysis and persistent thumbnail/preview issues after new builds, prompting a deeper dive into robust error handling and API responses.

<product_requirements>
The Claire et Marcus PWA is an AI-powered SaaS for small businesses, automating social media content and profile management. Key requirements and ongoing issues include:
*   **Persistent Data Synchronization**: Eliminate reappearing deleted content, incorrect counts, and ensure reliable saving/display of comments/descriptions. Solved by migrating to MongoDB.
*   **UI/UX for Content Library (Bibliothèque)**: Implement a 5-column grid, pop-up previews, delete, comment text area, batch operations, and image optimization.
*   **Comment Management**: Ensure comments persist and are immediately visible.
*   **System Integrity**: Prevent static demo data re-introduction and ensure display of user-owned content.
*   **General Fixes**: Resolve virtual keyboard issues (fixed for Entreprise and Réglages tabs), persist user profile data (settings), and refactor website analysis to use GPT-5.
*   **Thumbnail Generation**: Implement automatic 320px WEBP square thumbnails for images/videos (including HEIC/HEIF support), with backfill/async generation and MongoDB integration. This feature has been largely implemented but faces recurring issues with persistence across builds.
*   **Website Analysis Module**: Must function correctly, display real user data, and provide readable error messages.
*   **Notes Module**: Must allow saving and correctly display existing notes.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: The central FastAPI application, handling core API routes.
    -   **Importance**: Manages content, user authentication, business profiles, notes, and user settings. It has undergone extensive refactoring to integrate MongoDB and robust JWT authentication.
    -   **Changes Made**: All user-related and content endpoints (e.g., , , , , ) were updated to use  for strict authentication. New  (GET/PUT) and  (GET) endpoints were added. Thumbnail generation logic in  was refined to support HEIC/HEIF and use direct arguments for background tasks.
-   ** (New)**: Centralized module for robust JWT validation.
    -   **Importance**: Provides  to ensure consistent and strict user ID extraction from JWT tokens, preventing demo user fallbacks.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to encapsulate JWT decoding and validation logic.  and  were refactored to import and utilize this module.
-   ****: Handles AI-powered website analysis.
    -   **Importance**: Processes website URLs and provides analytical summaries.
    -   **Changes Made**: Authenticated endpoints ( POST,  GET) were updated to use the robust  from . Explicit  loading was added to ensure access to JWT secrets. The GET endpoint for analysis retrieval was fixed for async and database access.
-   ****: The main React component and frontend logic hub.
    -   **Importance**: Manages UI, user interactions, and frontend-to-backend communication.
    -   **Changes Made**: Authentication flow was refined, including updating  and . Input fields for Réglages were adapted for virtual keyboard compatibility. New  and  functions were implemented to manage personal settings persistence. Error handling for  was improved using . The  function was corrected to properly parse the API response.
-   ****: Frontend environment variables.
    -   **Importance**: Defines  for API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**: Repeatedly updated  to ensure it points to the correct production backend URL (), as it demonstrated a recurring issue of reverting to an incorrect URL.
-   ****: Backend Python dependencies.
    -   **Importance**: Manages necessary libraries for the FastAPI application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Corrected a typo ( to ) and ensured  was correctly listed for image processing.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical, recurring issues reported by the user following extensive work on MongoDB migration, thumbnail generation, and authentication stabilization.

The primary focus was on resolving the object Object error in the Website Analysis module and the failure of notes to display. The AI engineer applied the following corrections:
1.  **Website Analysis Module (Frontend)**: Implemented an  utility function in  and integrated it into the  function's error handling. This aims to display readable error messages instead of generic .
2.  **Website Analysis Module (Backend)**: Corrected the  (GET) endpoint in  to correctly handle  operations and database access. The engineer was in the process of implementing a more robust  (POST) endpoint with improved error handling, URL normalization, and size/timeout limits.
3.  **Notes Module (Frontend)**: The  function in  was modified to correctly extract the array of notes from the API response (), as the API returns an object containing the notes array.
4.  **Persistent Data Loss and ID Confusion**: A significant effort was made to resolve an issue where user data was spread across multiple MongoDB s, and new, empty accounts were being created. A Total Migration script was executed to unify all user data (business profile, notes, media, analyses) under the  that was consistently returned by the login process ().

Despite these comprehensive fixes, the user's most recent feedback indicates a severe regression:
*   The Website Analysis module *still* shows the object Object error on re-analysis.
*   Thumbnails and previews for uploaded photos are *not preserved* across new builds, reverting to their missing state, even after being confirmed functional in previous iterations. This suggests deep-rooted deployment or environmental persistence problems.
*   The Notes module *still* does not display saved notes.

The work currently suspended involves the implementation of the robust backend endpoint for website analysis ( as suggested by ChatGPT).
