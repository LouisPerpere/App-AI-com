<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully initiated a PWA SaaS application for social media content automation, SocialGénie, later intended to be renamed. The development followed an iterative approach, starting with core AI-driven content generation, then enhancing the UI, adding automation features, and recently, authentication and back-office functionalities. Key decisions included using OpenAI for content generation, addressing its API specifics for image handling, and implementing an anti-repetition mechanism for posts. The engineer proactively sought API keys and user preferences, ensuring adherence to the prompt's architectural and UI guidelines (React, FastAPI, MongoDB, Tailwind, Shadcn UI). Debugging steps, such as checking supervisor logs and correcting missing imports/dependencies, were also documented. The development consistently moved towards a complete SaaS solution, incorporating user feedback at each stage.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a PWA SaaS application for small businesses and freelancers to automate social media communication. Key features include:
1.  **Business Profile Setup:** Describe business, target audience, ad budget, tone for AI content generation. AI provides recommendations (publication rhythm, social networks, ad budget).
2.  **Content Upload:** Upload photos/videos with comments (audio/text transcription). Batch upload and deferred description (click to describe).
3.  **AI Analysis & Calendar:** AI analyzes content to propose a publication calendar for the next month. Textual notes for posts (e.g., closed May 8). AI generates content without classic ChatGPT markers (emojis, specific phrasing) and avoids repeating posts from the last 12 months.
4.  **Notification & Validation:** App notifies when posts are ready. User validates, rejects, or modifies posts via a carousel with a Validate and Schedule button and editable date/time.
5.  **Automated Publishing:** Validated posts are automatically sent to selected social networks (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn initially).
6.  **Periodic Automation:** Monthly content generation (for weekly/bi-weekly posts), weekly generation (for daily/3x/week posts), triggered by launch anniversary.
7.  **Reminders & Fallback:** Notifications (email) 3 days before generation to upload content, daily until sufficient content is uploaded. If insufficient, AI generates generic content (anecdotes, quotes, stock images).
8.  **Branding:** Company logo upload and display.
9.  **Social Media Connection:** User connects social media accounts (OAuth for Facebook/Instagram Business API, LinkedIn API).
10. **Authentication:** User login/signup pages.
11. **SaaS Back Office:** Admin dashboard for client/account management, subscriptions, discounts, referral system, and payment integration (Stripe, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the implementation and initial testing of the comprehensive authentication system. This includes user login and registration pages, secure password hashing, JWT token generation for session management (access and refresh tokens), automatic 14-day trial period after registration, and route protection. The backend now has a dedicated  module handling all authentication logic, and the  file integrates these authentication routes. On the frontend,  was updated to display the modern authentication pages (Se connecter / Créer un compte) with responsive design, secure password visibility toggle, loading states, and clear French error messages. The UI also reflects the PostCraft branding.

Following the successful authentication implementation, the AI engineer started working on the full SaaS back office. This involved creating new backend modules like  and  (though their full content is not yet visible in the trajectory, they were created). Crucially, the frontend's  was modified to integrate the admin dashboard, presumably to provide access points or UI elements for the upcoming back office functionalities. The current state is that the basic structure for the admin dashboard is integrated into the frontend, and the engineer is about to perform tests to verify its functionality and the newly added backend components.
