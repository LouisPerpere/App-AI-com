# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "CRITICAL DATA DISAPPEARING BUG: User-entered data disappears after 0.25 seconds in form fields, particularly affecting iPadOS 18 virtual keyboard devices. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Input fields using defaultValue='' instead of actual business profile/localStorage data, causing fields to reset on re-renders. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Updated all virtual keyboard input fields to use dynamic defaultValue from businessProfile or localStorage instead of empty strings. This prevents data loss during component re-renders triggered by API calls or state changes."

CACHE HEADERS**: ‚úÖ API endpoints have proper no-cache headers (no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate). **REMAINING ISSUES**: ‚ùå Thumbnail accessibility - /uploads/thumbs/ URLs return HTML instead of images (routing issue with frontend Express vs FastAPI backend), ‚ùå Thumbnail cache headers not working due to routing issue. **TECHNICAL VERIFICATION**: Fixed server.py async MongoDB operations to synchronous, migration script successfully moved 79 files to MongoDB with proper ObjectIds, all CRUD operations working with ObjectIds, authentication system functional. **CONCLUSION**: The core ObjectId mismatch issue has been COMPLETELY RESOLVED. All content operations now use proper MongoDB ObjectIds instead of UUIDs. The 36 vs 7 file discrepancy is resolved with consistent count of 43 files. Only thumbnail serving remains as a minor routing configuration issue."

TECHNICAL EVIDENCE**: Both claire-marcus.com and preview URL redirect to same application, login form accepts credentials but authentication token is not persisted, console logs show repeated checkAuth() calls returning false, application remains in unauthenticated state preventing access to content management features. **CRITICAL ISSUE**: The delete functionality code is correctly implemented, but users cannot reach it due to broken authentication.

TECHNICAL EVIDENCE: Comprehensive before/after testing shows business profile data unchanged by website analysis call.

This suggests a fundamental incompatibility with iPadOS 18+ virtual keyboard behavior in business profile context that may require alternative solutions such as different input libraries, PWA manifest changes, or viewport meta tag modifications."

The analysis function starts correctly but fails during JSON serialization. This explains why backend testing shows 100% functionality but users experience silent failures. The UI shows 'Aucune analyse disponible' because no API request is actually made. SOLUTION: Fix the data serialization in the analyzeWebsite function to exclude circular references before sending to backend."

Consider alternative solutions such as: (1) Native mobile app development, (2) Progressive Web App (PWA) with native input handling, (3) Third-party virtual keyboard libraries specifically designed for iPadOS 18+, (4) Server-side rendering with minimal client-side JavaScript. The RADICAL approach has definitively proven that React state management is not the root cause of this bug."

COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS (100% success rate): **EXACT SCENARIO TESTED**: (1) ‚úÖ Login with lperpere@yahoo.fr / L@Reunion974! - Authentication successful, JWT token obtained, User ID: 6a670c66-c06c-4d75-9dd5-c747e8a0281a, (2) ‚úÖ GET /api/business-profile current state - Retrieved existing profile data successfully, (3) ‚úÖ PUT with test data {'business_name': 'TEST UNIQUE 999', 'business_description': 'TEST DESC 999', 'website_url': 'https://test999.com'} - PUT operation successful with 200 status, (4) ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE GET after PUT - Retrieved data immediately after PUT operation, (5) ‚úÖ COMPARISON - PUT and GET data match perfectly, no discrepancies detected. **RACE CONDITION TESTING**: Tested data persistence with delays of 0s, 0.1s, 0.5s, 1.0s, 2.0s - all tests passed, data remained consistent. **USER ID CONSISTENCY**: Verified same user_id used across login, JWT validation, and database operations. **MONGODB VERIFICATION**: Direct database inspection confirmed: (1) ‚úÖ PUT operations correctly save to MongoDB, (2) ‚úÖ GET operations correctly retrieve from MongoDB, (3) ‚úÖ Data actually persists in database with proper timestamps, (4) ‚úÖ No race conditions between PUT and GET operations. **CRITICAL FINDING**: The discrepancy described in review request is NOT OCCURRING. Backend is working perfectly - PUT operations save data correctly, GET operations immediately return the same data, MongoDB persistence is functioning correctly. The backend system is operating as designed with full data integrity. If user experiences data disappearing, the issue must be in frontend implementation, not backend persistence."

        comment: "üîß CRITICAL FIX APPLIED: Fixed missing Authorization headers in frontend API calls causing 'Demo Business' data override. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Multiple API requests (loadGeneratedPosts, loadPendingContent, loadSocialConnections, etc.) were missing explicit Authorization headers, causing them to fall back to demo mode even for authenticated users. SOLUTION: Added explicit Authorization: Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('access_token')} headers to ALL API requests that were missing them. This ensures authenticated users always get their real data instead of demo fallbacks. FIXED ENDPOINTS: /business-profile (2 instances), /posts, /content/pending, /social/connections, /social/facebook/auth-url, /linkedin/auth-url, /social/connection/{id} DELETE, /content/batch-upload, /business-profile POST. This should resolve the user's issue of seeing 'D√©mo Business' data return on page reload."

        comment: "üîß ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION HEADER FIXES: Found and fixed 2 more API requests missing explicit Authorization headers: DELETE /api/notes/{noteId} and GET /api/auth/me (with timeout). Also fixed backend database schema to include missing fields (business_description, budget_range, email) in _create_default_business_profile to match Pydantic model. Backend logs confirm token validation working correctly for authenticated requests and proper fallback to demo mode for requests without Authorization headers. All API requests now use explicit headers instead of relying on axios.defaults which can have race conditions."
