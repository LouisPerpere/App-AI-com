The trajectory details the iterative development of the Claire et Marcus PWA by the previous AI engineer. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing core features like MongoDB content migration and robust JWT authentication, which addressed data persistence and user session issues. Key challenges included implementing a new thumbnail generation system with HEIC/HEIF support and fixing recurring UI errors like [object Object].

A significant portion of the work revolved around resolving persistent login failures, particularly on Safari and due to  misconfigurations or Render.com's cold start issues. The engineer meticulously applied frontend  fallbacks, backend CORS policies, and corrected API endpoint availability. The latest critical issue involved a white screen on the frontend caused by an erroneous  placeholder in , which the engineer is now tasked with resolving by restoring the file and applying targeted fixes for the pending full migration to Emergent infrastructure. The user has provided the required  content.

<product_requirements>
The Claire et Marcus PWA is an AI-powered SaaS for small businesses, aiming to automate social media content and profile management.
The core functionalities and issues addressed include:
*   **Persistent Data Synchronization**: Ensuring reliable saving, display, and deletion of content and comments via MongoDB.
*   **Content Library (Bibliothèque)**: UI/UX for a 5-column grid, pop-up previews, batch operations, and image optimization.
*   **Thumbnail Generation**: Automatic 320px WEBP thumbnails for images/videos (including HEIC/HEIF), with asynchronous generation, MongoDB/GridFS storage, and persistence across builds.
*   **Website Analysis Module**: AI-powered analysis with readable error messages, using GPT-5, and displaying real user data.
*   **Notes Module**: Ability to save and correctly display notes.
*   **Business Profile/Settings**: User profile data and business settings must persist, and the Entreprise tab should directly show editable fields, not an onboarding screen.
*   **Authentication Flow**: Robust login across all browsers (including Safari private mode), persistent user sessions, and clear error messaging for server connectivity issues.
*   **Infrastructure Autonomy**: User's explicit request to migrate off Emergent.sh for a fully autonomous deployment on Render.com (backend) and Netlify (frontend), then later full repatriation to Emergent infrastructure.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database, including GridFS for file storage).
-   **Data Persistence**: Migration from ephemeral filesystem to MongoDB/GridFS for all user data, content, and thumbnails.
-   **API Design**: RESTful content/user management, JWT authentication (), unified error responses (e.g., ).
-   **Image/Video Processing**: Pillow (HEIC/HEIF support), FFmpeg for thumbnail generation, optional  import.
-   **Deployment & Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Supervisor, Render.com, Netlify, environment variables (, ).
-   **Authentication**: JWT validation,  with  fallback, ,  header,  with API endpoint fallbacks.
-   **Frontend State/UI**:  for virtual keyboard inputs, loading overlays, dynamic URL construction.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: The central FastAPI application.
    -   **Importance**: Coordinates all API routes, authentication, and core business logic.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensively refactored for MongoDB and robust JWT authentication (). Implemented ,  (with thumbnail generation). **Crucially, updated to include CORS policies for , , , . Global FastAPI exception handlers for uniform error responses (422, HTTPException). Explicitly added  and  endpoints to ensure full API coverage on Render. Made  import optional to prevent build failures.**
-   ****: Centralized module for robust JWT validation.
    -   **Importance**: Ensures consistent user ID extraction and authentication.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to encapsulate JWT decoding and validation ().
-   ****: Handles AI-powered website analysis.
    -   **Importance**: Processes website URLs and provides analytical summaries via ChatGPT.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated endpoints to use . Implemented robust website analysis logic including URL normalization, timeouts, size limits, HTML content-type checks, and unified error responses (). Integrated ChatGPT calls with robust fallback mechanisms.
-   ** (New)**: Contains core logic for thumbnail generation.
    -   **Importance**: Generates 320px WEBP/PNG/JPEG thumbnails from source images/videos, including HEIC/HEIF.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented logic for image/video processing.
-   ** (New)**: Defines API routes for thumbnail management.
    -   **Importance**: Exposes endpoints for streaming, generating, rebuilding, checking status, and reporting orphan thumbnails.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created routes including  (streaming),  (on-demand), , , . **Updated  to accept  query parameter for authentication.**
-   ** (New)**: Defines API routes for content uploads and deletion.
    -   **Importance**: Manages the storage of original files in GridFS and associated media documents.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created routes for  (single file GridFS),  (multiple files GridFS), and  (stream original from GridFS). **Added  to remove media, GridFS file, and thumbnail.**
-   ****: The main React component and frontend logic hub.
    -   **Importance**: Manages UI, user interactions, and all frontend-to-backend communication.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        *   **Auth**:  replaced with . .  utility introduced (with  and  fallback for Safari private mode) and integrated across all token usage.  logic enhanced to try  and fallback to  if a 404 is received. Added a 100ms delay in  and strict URL normalization for .
        *   **UI/UX**: Input fields for Réglages adapted for virtual keyboard.  integrated for website analysis. **Force  and  to bypass onboarding screen. Implemented  and  to use  for all thumbnail/preview rendering.** Added a loading popup for login to manage Render cold starts. Fixed payload for  to  and added  before re-analysis. Enabled  for single and batch deletion.
-   ****: Handles user authentication.
    -   **Importance**: Manages login forms, local token storage, and initial API pings.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on resolving a critical white screen issue on the  frontend. This was diagnosed as a JavaScript error (REPLACE_SECTION is not defined) originating from an accidentally introduced placeholder string in  that got bundled into the deployed application. This issue is independent of the backend infrastructure (Render or Emergent).

The user had expressed a desire to fully repatriate both the backend and frontend to Emergent's infrastructure. The AI engineer was awaiting the user to restore the  file from a healthy state on GitHub. Once the user provided the content of a previous  version, the current task is to meticulously apply a set of necessary, targeted fixes to this restored  to ensure core functionalities (login, business profile display, content library with thumbnails/previews, deletion, website analysis) work correctly. These fixes address various issues identified throughout the trajectory, such as  fallbacks for Safari, correct URL construction, and specific API payload structures, as well as fixing the new issues introduced by the provided  content (e.g., duplicate  attributes, duplicate  declarations).
