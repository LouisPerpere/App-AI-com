The AI engineer's work on the Claire et Marcus PWA involved a detailed, iterative process of feature implementation, bug fixing, and UI/UX refinement. Key achievements include the initial setup and stabilization of social media integrations, fixing persistent content display issues, and enhancing post generation logic. A significant effort was dedicated to developing a manual date/time modification feature, requiring a modern UI and robust backend endpoints. Extensive debugging focused on button functionality, state persistence, and synchronizing data across Posts and Calendar views. Recurring challenges included Valider button behavior, / inconsistencies, and React rendering issues. The engineer meticulously used debugging tools, , and adapted to user feedback, culminating in a complex multi-step modification workflow and a simplified, yet powerful, calendar interface. The trajectory ends with the user requesting to hide certain buttons during the modification process to enhance clarity.

The Claire et Marcus PWA automates social media content generation using AI. The initial problem involved stabilizing Instagram integration, migrating to Facebook Login for Business, fixing content management issues (e.g., 0/22 items displayed, URL bloquée, phantom posts), and integrating LLMs. Subsequent requirements focused on:
- Refining post generation (proportional, next-day scheduling, per-network generation).
- Implementing manual date/time modification for posts via a popup with a calendar and spinners, with specific limits, later clarified to be based on the post's attributed month.
- Enhancing the Valider button: remove social network selection popup, use post's date/time, provide visual validation feedback.
- Improving the calendar UI: clear filter labels, condensed statistics, correct layout, and the ability to view, move, and cancel scheduled posts directly from the calendar. This evolved to requiring modification capabilities for validated posts *only* within the calendar, while they remain read-only in the Posts tab.
- Forcing a read-only mode for validated posts in the Posts tab, replacing modification options with a Programmé badge.
- Refining the post modification workflow to include an AI rephrasing step, presenting a modified text preview with Confirmer, Annuler, Modifier à nouveau options, with auto-scrolling.
- Simplifying calendar post actions: remove Modifier button, rename Annuler to Déprogrammer, add explanatory text for modifications.
- Address UX issues like immediate post text updates post-confirmation and auto-scrolling.
- The latest request is to hide the Valider and original Modifier buttons when the modification workflow is active, to avoid confusion.

<code_architecture>

- ****: Main FastAPI application handling all backend logic, API routes, and database interactions.
    - **Importance**: Central for all data operations (CRUD for posts, auth, payments, etc.).
    - **Changes Made**:
        - : Modified to include the  field in the response (Chat 63).
        - Added : Endpoint to retrieve calendar posts (Chat 325).
        - : Debug logs added (Chat 327). Corrected  usage for post retrieval (Chat 319-320 context, fixed by sub-agent).
        - : Corrected to query  collection using  (Chat 416).
        - : Corrected to query  collection using , and to set , , and remove  (Chat 427).

- ****: Main React component managing frontend UI, state, and user interactions. Contains  and  components.
    - **Importance**: Renders the entire application, handling post display, modification, and calendar views.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - ****: Logic refined for read-only mode for  posts in the Posts tab, displaying a Programmé badge and hiding action buttons (Chat 358, 362).
        - ****:
            - Moved globally (outside tabs) for universal access (Chat 108, 110).
            - Updated to include image thumbnails for calendar posts (Chat 82).
            - Buttons redesigned: Valider removed, Annuler renamed to Supprimer (later Déprogrammer), with confirmation modal (Chat 131, 133, 137, 369, 371).
            - Modification workflow enhanced: New states added for preview (, , ), and functions (, , ) (Chat 180, 433, 435, 522).
            - UI for modification preview added, with Confirmer, Annuler, Modifier à nouveau buttons (Chat 196, 439).
            - Auto-scrolling implemented for modification preview and secondary modification area using  and  (Chat 524, 526, 534, 540).
            - Logic for closing modification sub-windows: Confirmer closes all, Annuler closes last (Chat 548, 550, 556).
        - ****: Backend  field included in response (Chat 63), frontend logic improved for synchronization.
        - ****: Created to handle modifications from calendar without page reload; returns modified data for preview (Chat 153, 155, 190). Corrected to extract  correctly from backend response (Chat 266). Includes API call to save modifications (Chat 343, 345).

- Work with infrastructure team to resolve any remaining external proxy/cache issues.
- Finalize carousel display logic (grey placeholder instead of first image).
- Continue to apply and verify all corrections on the LIVE environment.
- The minor issue where the secondary modification area disappears after the second AI processing, preventing full testing of differentiated cancellation, could be revisited.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was finalizing the enhanced modification workflow. The user had confirmed that the multi-step modification process was working, including immediate text updates and auto-scrolling, and that confirming a modification correctly closed all sub-windows.

The current work involves addressing the user's latest request to improve the user experience during the modification process. Specifically, the AI engineer is tasked with hiding the primary Valider and Modifier buttons of a post when the advanced modification workflow is actively being used (i.e., when the modification function is open). This is intended to prevent confusion between the Confirmer button within the modification workflow and the Valider or Modifier buttons related to the post itself. The AI engineer has just acknowledged this request and stated a plan to implement this logic immediately.
