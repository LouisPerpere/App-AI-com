The AI engineer's work involved incrementally enhancing the Claire et Marcus PWA, focusing on social media post generation, content management, and UI/UX improvements. The trajectory began with fixing an image attachment modal error (), then expanded to implement carousel support, improve metadata handling for uploads, and refine the business profile saving mechanism. Significant effort was also put into fixing frontend interaction issues, such as the virtual keyboard bug and improving the visual feedback for post modifications. The AI engineer demonstrated a methodical approach, iteratively addressing bugs, implementing new features, and validating changes through screenshots and backend test agents. The work culminated in an automatic page reload and scroll-to-post feature after modifications, aiming for a seamless user experience, but ended with a critical Écran blanc error.

The Claire et Marcus PWA aims to automate social media for small businesses. Initial features included content CRUD, a content library, thumbnails, AI website analysis, notes, and authentication. The user's explicit requests and intents throughout this trajectory included:
1.  **Post Generation & Management**: Generate an Instagram calendar based on business profile, website analysis, uploads, and notes. Posts require visuals, text, and scheduled day/time. Content balance, target audience prioritization, and avoidance of AI-generated language/excessive emojis are crucial. The number of posts must adapt to . Users must be able to modify generated posts and attach/modify visuals (from library, Pixabay, or direct upload) to posts, with used images marked.
2.  **Content Organization & Display**: Monthly collapsible sections (6-month chronological) for content and notes, with larger thumbnails and improved UI/UX (consistent buttons, reduced margins).
3.  **Image & Video Handling**: Unified upload with multi-month and carousel options. Correct video playback and 720p compression on upload.
4.  **Specific UI/UX Enhancements**: Fix  error, ensure direct uploads link to the current month, display green check badges on used images, improve marketing language for upload areas, ensure post text is always accessible in image attachment modals, fix badge overlaps, and implement a virtual keyboard fix.
5.  **Backend Robustness**: Correct  to  handling for images, ensure business profile data (, email) saves persistently, and provide a full post deletion feature for testing.
6.  **Interactive Feedback**: Display a spinner and modification in progress overlay during post modifications, with automatic post update and page reload/scroll to the modified post.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing an automatic page reload and scroll-to-post feature following successful post modifications. This involved:
1.  **Frontend Logic ()**:
    *   Using  to store the ID of the modified post and a flag () before reloading the page.
    *   On page load, checking  to automatically navigate to the Posts tab.
    *   Scrolling to the modified post using its  attribute and applying a visual flash animation.
2.  **CSS ()**:
    *   Defining the  and  class for the visual feedback.

The goal was to provide a seamless user experience where modifications update automatically without manual page refresh. The AI engineer reported the feature as complètement terminée et opérationnelle (completely finished and operational). However, the subsequent user message reported an Écran blanc. Quelquechose s’est passé (White screen. Something happened), indicating a critical runtime error in the application. The current work is in a broken state due to this newly introduced bug. The AI engineer's last action was to check backend logs for errors, finding none immediately.
