The AI engineer has successfully guided the PostCraft application from its initial MVP phase through significant feature enhancements and a complete rebranding, culminating in a stable deployment setup on Netlify (frontend) and Render.com (backend). The work involved extensive UI/UX refinement, implementation of core functionalities like content management and AI-powered analytics, and critical infrastructure setup including payment processing and social media integrations. Challenges encountered primarily revolved around deployment configurations and dependency management, especially with  and Node.js/Python versioning issues across different hosting environments. The AI engineer adeptly troubleshooted these, often simplifying the backend to achieve successful deployment before re-integrating complex features. The focus has now shifted to guiding the user through the final deployment configuration, specifically connecting the deployed Render backend to the Netlify frontend.

PostCraft, now rebranded as Claire et Marcus, is a PWA SaaS designed to automate social media for small businesses and freelancers. It enables users to establish a business profile (with AI recommendations), upload various content types (photos, videos, text, batch uploads, deferred descriptions), and receive AI-generated monthly publication calendars. The core promise is unique, non-repetitive content without ChatGPT markers, which users can validate before automated publishing to Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Key features include periodic content generation, upload reminders, fallback generic content, logo branding, and a comprehensive SaaS back office for client, subscription, and payment management (initially planned for Stripe, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal).

Recent enhancements included new subscription plans (1-month free; Starter: €14.99/month, 4 posts/month, 1 network; Rocket: €29.99/month, unlimited posts, all networks; Pro: €199.99/month, unlimited posts, multi-accounts) and a website analysis feature (with ChatGPT) for content generation, including quarterly analysis and manual re-analysis. The application's UI was refined for a sexy marketing aesthetic, emphasizing time-saving benefits. A smart paywall system with conditional pop-ups and feature blocking based on subscription status was introduced, along with measures to prevent multiple free trials. User requests also explicitly included making all elements in the business profile editable and dynamically displaying the subscription pop-up based on the user's selected publication rhythm (e.g., after the second-to-last validated post). The final major user request was a complete rebranding to Claire et Marcus, including logo and slogan integration, and dynamic typography.

• Configurer MongoDB Atlas
• Ajouter les DNS sur OVH, , , **: New deployment-related scripts and guides.
    -   **Importance:** Provide clear instructions for setting up hosting environments.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the full implementation and testing of the SaaS back office, including the full suite of payment providers (Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal), as only basic Stripe (simplified due to  issues) is currently in place.
-   Re-integrate and fully enable backend modules like , , and  into the deployed  on Render.com, as the current deployed  is an ultra-minimal version that bypasses these to achieve initial deployment. This includes proper MongoDB connection.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was guiding the user through the process of deploying the Claire et Marcus application.
The frontend has been successfully deployed on Netlify, and the user has just confirmed that the backend (after multiple troubleshooting steps) has also been successfully deployed on Render.com with the URL .

The main challenge addressed in the recent messages was getting the backend to deploy on Render.com, which involved:
1.  **Addressing Node.js version incompatibility on Netlify:** The AI engineer updated  and added a  file to force Netlify to use Node.js 20, resolving build issues.
2.  **Migrating backend hosting from Railway to Render.com:** Due to Railway's new paid plan requirement for applications, Render.com was chosen as a free alternative.
3.  **Troubleshooting Render.com deployment errors:** This was a multi-step process:
    *   Initially,  library caused a  because it's not publicly available on PyPI. The AI engineer removed this library from  and simplified  and  to remove its dependencies.
    *   A subsequent error, , indicated an issue with the MongoDB connection string, likely due to an unconfigured or improperly escaped  in Render's environment variables, or an attempt by  to connect too early.
    *   To finally achieve deployment success, the AI engineer created an ultra-minimal  that removes all imports of local modules (like , , ) and thus, any direct MongoDB connection at startup. This ensures the FastAPI server can start on Render without immediate dependency failures. This effectively puts the backend into a demo mode.

The user has confirmed the Render deployment is successful and has asked for instructions on where to put this backend URL in Netlify. The AI engineer has provided precise instructions to set the  environment variable in the Netlify dashboard to .

Confirm with the user that the  has been set in Netlify, and then offer to perform a full end-to-end test of the deployed application.
