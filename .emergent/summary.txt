The AI engineer's work primarily focused on refining the Claire et Marcus PWA, tackling several critical bugs and implementing complex new features. Key challenges included a recurring backend URL misconfiguration causing login failures, persistent virtual keyboard issues on mobile inputs, and a video playback . Each issue required deep debugging across frontend and backend, leading to fixes like absolute URL construction,  for uncontrolled components, and HTTP Range header support for video streaming. Major feature additions involved overhauling content and notes organization into collapsible monthly sections, enhancing Pixabay integration, introducing carousel uploads, and implementing robust video compression. The trajectory concludes with the initial setup for the highly complex post generation system, laying the groundwork for AI-driven content creation.

<product_requirements>
The Claire et Marcus PWA aims to automate social media content for small businesses. Initial features included content CRUD, a 5-column library, 320px WEBP thumbnails, AI website analysis, notes, profiles, and authentication. User requirements during this trajectory focused on:
1.  **Monthly Organization**: Content and notes displayed in collapsible, chronological monthly sections (current, future, archives), extended to cover 6 months. Current month and important notes are open by default.
2.  **Flexible Uploads**: Unified Uploader vos contenus button with Upload (multi-month, per-photo attribution) and Carrousel (batch, shared metadata, stacked vignette).
3.  **Enhanced Pixabay Integration**: When adding Pixabay images, users can attribute to a specific month and modify title/context. Hashtags default to context, not title.
4.  **Performance Fixes**: Resolve slow Pixabay thumbnail reloading (already done, confirmed earlier).
5.  **UI/UX**: Consistent button sizing, reduced margins/paddings for notes and library pages, enlarged thumbnails, repositioned Pixabay badge.
6.  **Video Playback & Compression**: Videos must play correctly (bug fix) and be compressed to a maximum of 720p during upload.
7.  **Post Generation (Core Feature)**: Create a calendar of publications based on business profile, website analysis, uploads (current, unused older, Pixabay), and notes (valid, current month). Content must balance types and prioritize target audiences. Posts require a visual, text, day, and time for each social network (initially Instagram).

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main FastAPI application, API routes.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified  to accept  and . Endpoint for  and  exist, and new code is being added to integrate .
-   ****: No changes mentioned in the trajectory, but important for thumbnail generation.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles file uploads.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Implemented HTTP Range header support for  to enable video streaming (206 Partial Content, ).
        -   Added video compression logic (max 720p with FFmpeg) to both single and batch upload functions, with a size-based trigger and a 5-minute duration limit.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains automatic content generation logic.
    -   **Changes Made**: Identified to have import issues and an unimplemented  function, which needs to be rectified for post generation.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Importance**: New file created to house the core logic for AI-powered post generation.
    -   **Changes Made**: File created, now being integrated.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central React component.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensive:
        -   **Monthly Organization**: Extended month options to 6 months for notes and uploads, implemented default collapse states (current month and important notes open).
        -   **Notes UI**: Unified month selector, reduced margins, enlarged text areas.
        -   **Library UI**: Enlarged content thumbnails (changed grid from 4/5/6 cols to 3/4/5), reduced margins, repositioned Pixabay badge.
        -   **Pixabay Modal**: Added custom title/context input fields, default Pixabay tags to context, use  for inputs to fix virtual keyboard bug, implemented data persistence.
        -   **Uploads**: Fixed bug where changing attribution month cleared title/context fields.
        -   **Video Playback**: Constructed absolute URLs for uploaded videos and fallback links using .
        -   **Post Generation**: Contains UI for Posts tab, generation button, and modal.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stylesheet.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modifications for consistent button sizes, container widths, and carousel stack effect. (Minor adjustments to support  UI changes).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Frontend environment variables.
    -   **Changes Made**: Repeatedly corrected  to the correct preview URL () due to persistent resets.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Implement full Post Generation logic**: This is the major, complex feature requested and currently being worked on.
-   **Correct  imports/unimplemented functions**: Address issues like the missing  function.
-   **Integrate LLM into Post Generation**: Utilize  for actual AI content generation.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently initiating the development of the génération de posts (post generation) system, which is described as the core and most complex feature of the application.

Based on the detailed product requirements provided by the user, this system will:
1.  **Create a publication calendar** based on user-defined number of posts.
2.  **Gather content from multiple sources**:
    *    page: Business profile, target audience.
    *    page: Website analysis.
    *    page: Titles and contexts of content (images/videos) from the current month.
    *    page: Notes toujours valables and notes for the current month.
3.  **Handle insufficient content**: Prioritize unused uploads from older months. If still insufficient, search for royalty-free Pixabay photos, using website analysis and business profile for tailored searches.
4.  **Ensure content balance**: Respect an equilibrium of content types (e.g., product highlights, behind-the-scenes, educational) adapted to the user's business.
5.  **Target audience**: Prioritize audience descriptions from the  page, or fallback to website analysis.
6.  **Generated Post Structure**: Each post will consist of a visual, text, and a publication day/time for each social network. Initially, the focus is on Instagram.
7.  **Display**: Posts will appear on the  page with a presentation similar to uploads and notes.

The AI engineer has identified existing frontend (Posts tab, generation button, modal with prerequisites checklist) and backend (,  endpoints in ,  in ) structures. Critical backend issues, such as missing  and import problems in , have been noted.

The immediate actions taken are:
1.  Verification of  library installation.
2.  Creation of a new backend file: , which is intended to encapsulate the core logic for this feature.
3.  Modification of  to integrate and define endpoints for using this new  system.

The work is at the very beginning of implementing the complex AI generation logic.
