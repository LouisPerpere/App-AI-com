<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully initiated PostCraft, a PWA SaaS for social media automation. The development trajectory highlights an iterative process, evolving from core AI content generation to comprehensive UI/UX redesign, robust authentication, and foundational back-office systems. Key efforts included integrating Facebook/Instagram APIs, implementing a Stripe payment gateway (with a demo mode for testing), and developing a novel website content analysis feature powered by OpenAI (with intelligent fallback). Significant challenges involved persistent JSX syntax errors, resolving OpenAI API quota issues, and addressing multiple UI/UX refinements requested by the user, such as removing AI mentions, enhancing marketing aesthetics, and optimizing navigation. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, adapting to user feedback for design and functionality, culminating in a highly polished and feature-rich MVP. The current state involves refining the Notes section's content upload functionality.

<product_requirements>
PostCraft, a PWA SaaS, automates social media for small businesses and freelancers. Core requirements include business profile setup with AI recommendations, content upload (photos/videos, text, batch, deferred description), and AI analysis to propose a monthly publication calendar, ensuring unique, non-repetitive content without ChatGPT markers. Users receive notifications for ready posts, allowing validation/modification before automatic publication to selected networks (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn). The app features periodic content generation, reminders for uploads, and fallback generic content. Branding includes logo upload. Essential functionalities encompass user authentication and a comprehensive SaaS back office for client, subscription, and payment management (Stripe, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal). Recently, the user requested new subscription plans (1 month free; Starter: €14.99/month, 4 posts/month, 1 network; Rocket: €29.99/month, unlimited posts, all networks; Pro: €199.99/month, unlimited posts, multi-accounts for community managers), and a website analysis feature (with ChatGPT) for content generation, including quarterly analysis and a manual re-analysis button.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on fulfilling the user's request to refine the homepage marketing copy, adjust the visibility of commercial offers, and restore content upload zones for the Bibliothèque and Notes tabs.

The homepage text automatisez was successfully changed to reflect an aid rather than automation. The display of commercial offers was made conditional, so they only appear for trial or expired users, not on all pages, enhancing UX.

The work then shifted to restoring the missing content upload functionality for the Bibliothèque and Notes tabs. The Bibliothèque tab's content was successfully updated to include the actual upload interface, reusing existing file upload functions.

The engineer is currently in the process of implementing the complete interface for the Notes tab. During this implementation, a lint error () was encountered, indicating that the  and  functions, although referenced by existing variables, are not fully defined or correctly integrated. The engineer has identified that the  function exists and is now in the process of adding the missing  and  functions to the  file, looking for an appropriate location for their definition.
